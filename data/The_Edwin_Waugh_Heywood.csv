No idea where to start!!
We visit Heywood Wetherspoons around once a month usually it‚Äôs ok.
Todays visit was absolutely shocking
We ordered on the app staff came to tell us some items were not available so what else did we want when I asked I was told whatever üò°
Then when  our food arrived I was given chips with my sandwich when we asked for no chips but salad on the app.
Not once did a member of staff come to ask us was everything ok with our food because it wasn‚Äôt at all the burger and sandwich was extremely bland.
We then ordered some drinks through the app again and ordered real ales this all went through then some time later another member of staff appeared to say we don‚Äôt have the ales so yet again we had to pick something else.
The staff were going around as if they didn‚Äôt want to be there no smile very unfriendly not one of them said anything like thank you or your welcome
