It was that filthy I had to go over it with baby wipes. Other customers that had come in just after us also had to clear their own tables and asked for baby wipes to clean their table down. When ordering food it took around 20 minutes to be served at the bar. I over saw a staff member being very rude to a customer when he was trying to order his food. To where she started to scream on top note in his face, smashed a glass on the floor and ran off to the kitchen. Once I finally got served me and my family managed to get our food.
