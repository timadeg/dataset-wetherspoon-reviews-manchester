Chorlton Tyres,5 years ago,5,"What is TerraClean? TerraClean is a unique technology process which is highly effective in removing the carbon deposits which build up in any internal combustion engine. The brand TerraClean is applied to both the equipment and the chemicals used.

What type of vehicles can be TerraCleaned?  We can TerraClean most vehicles; Motorcycles, Cars, Vans,Trucks, Agricultural, Plant and Machinery. Fuel injected vehicles – Port and Direct into and carburettor vehicles are all capable of being TerraCleaned.

Are there any vehicles you do notTerraClean?  We can TerraClean nearly all combustion engines with the exception of the Mazda Rotary Wankle engine and 2- stroke engines that do NOT have an independent oil supply i.e. not pre-mix engines.

Can you TerraClean a Direct InjectionEngine?  Yes we can. Even though the fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber the TerraClean process is very effective post detonation and will continue to clean through engine gas recirculation and down to rear of the exhaust system.

Will TerraClean clean my EGR Valve?  TerraClean can help restore EGR valves but if the EGR is heavily carboned a separate cleaning process may be required. Most importantly TerraClean is the best method for preventing the root cause of the carbon buildup that causes EGR valves and other components to fail.

Will TerraClean clean my DPF filter?  DPF filters are similar to honeycombs, if the DPF is completely blocked it is difficult to clean, however TerraClean will passively clean a DPF filter.

I am concerned removing carbon will damage my engine and reduce compression?  Leaving carbon in your engine will damage your engine! Carbon robs your engine of performance, causes pre-ignition (pinging),increases emissions and lowers fuel mileage. All of these add extra wear and tear on the engine. Removing the carbon at regular service intervals restores engine performance, allows for cleaner burn and extends engine life.

Where does the technology originate?  TerraClean technology was developed and is manufactured in Canada.

Can TerraClean damage my vehicle’s engine?  No, the TerraClean process carried out by one of our trained operators is safe for your vehicle.

What makes TerraClean better than the pour in decarboniser I have been using for years?  The primary reason pour-in products are less effective is that they are heavily diluted by the onboard fuel and try to clean the engine while under load (vehicle is running normally day to day). Under load,combustion is less efficient and can in fact, create more carbon due to poor combustion in an already carboned engine due to poor combustion.

Pour-in products may create more harm than good. An effective cleaning chemical added to a fuel tank would require such a high concentration that could damage the fuel pump and elastomers within the fuel system, cost much more and still only provide a short term solution.
TerraClean is different.
First, connecting the TerraClean machine directly to the fuel rail and bypassing the vehicle’s fuel tank means the service is using 100% TerraClean fluid, when passed through our unique reactor in the machine is what creates the cleaning action. TerraClean’s nano-technology removes carbon from the engine one molecule at a time rather than dissolving carbon with heavy and aggressive solvents. This is how TerraClean not only cleans the fuel rail and injectors, but also the combustion chamber, Oxygen sensor (lambda sensor),catalytic converter to improve overall performance, lower emission and improve fuel economy.",15,2263,True,4,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGW3EFajcbaKY9iv-ckoRpiauh3-chNYWhLeDr=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdLXJSxGL25L4GfiyI-eLEe0eF5BXH8IZlknfu=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAh6o3qsQ6VuaoKL0jsN88k08cbwEXweDqZj5S=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMO_Ok4z5zPn_N-3RAzCIbKhTCFwD0-eZ-SNwhb=w450-h338-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Bruce M,10 months ago,3,"We are all in this Crisis together.. Wetherspoons, despite everything have made a huge amount of profit over the years. This has been made by squeezing the life out of the brewers, working the staff as hard as they can and skimping on the essentials to make places more inviting. Our last visit only a few weeks ago was pretty poor. The food is no longer good value and the place was cold and smelled of damp like a run down empty house. It was Steak day.. My Rump steak was rare... not medium as I asked. It was served with a small jacket potato... Nothing else.. The others in my party were similarly disappointed. In these troubled times "" Eating out "" is a real luxury. We cannot afford to go out at all anymore. The lasting memory of this disastrous and expensive trip to Chorlton for what used to be a decent meal out, will stay in our thoughts for a long time. The only saving grace...

Skylark Silverwood,4 years ago,4,"The Sedge Lynn, known affectionately to some locals as 'the Sludge Bin,' occupies a former temperance billiards hall and still retains much of its original decor. Its greatest selling point is the unusual building itself, with its vast barrel vaulted ceiling and Rennie Mackintosh-style window panes. Its clientele is a broad mix of locals and students. All ages and social classes are represented, from old men who frequent the corners of the pub on a daily basis and resolutely drink the same beer every evening, to the bearded hipsters seeking guest craft ales at prices that put all the neighbouring trendy bars and tap rooms to shame.
As it's a Wetherspoons pub, your wallet will be very happy as this is probably the cheapest watering hole in Chorlton, and there's a surprisingly good range of drinks on offer, although this may change thanks to the Brexit-obsessed opinions of the chain's owner who firmly believes in keeping foreign products out of the UK, although new world wines seem to be acceptable. The food is cheap and cheerful and clearly prepared off site and then microwaved, and this is reflected in the lightning speed of getting your food to your table. Don't expect gourmet dishes either and you'll be fine. This is belt and braces fayre. The main downside is inconsistency. Depending on who is pressing the reheat button in the kitchen, your meal can be piping hot and well cooked, or moulten and rubbery. It's always a bit of a lottery. There's no music in an Wetherspoons outlet, either live or recorded, and this can actually make for a better social experience as you can hear what your companions are saying to you without having to battle overly-loud background muzak or enduring Ed Sheeran clones droning on in a corner. All in all it's a good no-frills boozer with more character than you might expect from a 'Spoons establishment, but maybe that's because it's in Chorlton, where the population is not typical of Manchester as a whole.",7,No photos count,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
