Speaking of pints, the drink selection is impressive, with a wide range of beers, ales, ciders, and cocktails on offer. The pub often features local and regional brews, allowing you to explore a taste of Manchester's beer culture.

And that can be rather tricky during peak times.
Speaking of food: While the dishes are the same at all the Wetherspoon pubs, prices vary between individual pubs (usually, the food is more expensive at metropolitan Spoons). There's always a rotating selection of inexpensive cask ales available, and generally every variety of alcoholic drinks imaginable - at the lowest prices in Britain. The interior of this particular Spoon isn't as grubby as some, but not as stylish as others. It's pretty much your middle-of-the-road, average JDW pub.

Been to this weatherspoons multiple times with my gf and the atmosphere is always so chill and friendly, even if it is sometimes a bit busy.

With my gf being out of town she wanted to treat me to a dessert so ordered online using my table number. In the last mouthful of the ice cream I had there was a tiny thin sheet of what seemed like plastic in it, I can only assume from the ice cream tub or something similar that had chipped into it. I took it out of my mouth and set it aside to inform the staff, not really bothered as I‚Äôve never had any issues before in my many visits.

As Kiera was going by I got her attention to inform her and let her know about the plastic but also let her know I‚Äôm not too bothered about it as I‚Äôd already eaten the full thing and it was in the last bite. Kiera showed amazing hospitality skills immediately acknowledging the issue and informing her manager straight away whilst apologising.

Stretford Sue,3 years ago,2,"My friend and I visit this Wetherspoons occasionally and had our meal at the approx time of 6.30 - 6.45 p.m. yesterday 25th September 2020.

We were treating ourselves with a Girls night out and this was a disappointing start to the evening for us both.

I had the Fish and Chips with Peas priced at ¬£10 + ( we were not given a receipt, so not exactly sure about the price ) My friend had the Simple Steak.

The Simple Steak is a new item on the menu, we were told.

The Simple Steak came on the usual big blue Wetherspoons plates and consisted of very a small steak, and one very small baked potato and a small pot of sauce, nothing else.

It was a child-size portion and therefor overpriced at ¬£12

It was such a small-sized portion, that when a staff member did the customer 'check-back' we had to comment and complain, to him and also the Manager, who came over to us and who gave us the head office phone number so we could contact them directly and complain.

My friend and I are not ones to complain normally but with this 'meal' being such an overpriced meal we had to comment.

The staff were very polite and listened and agreed but said that the portion was correct as this is how the portion size is for this new item on the menu.

Both meals were served quickly and were nice and hot and tasted very good, no complaints there.

but I had a meal on my plate with the fish and chips I ordered but my friend a small snack, not a meal.

Neve Robinson,3 years ago,1,"Absolutely awful experience here in Spoons. We ordered on the app; just wraps and paninis, and our order took at least 45 minutes. We were informed there was no tuna - despite the fact I paid for that and simply had to have cheese and tomato instead. To compensate for this they sent over a cheap and unpleasant tasting can of a fizzy pop. I'm a diabetic so it felt like  a direct, targeted threat on my life just because I complained at the lack of tuna. Then, my friends decided to order 4 apple shots, and I ordered some mushy peas to go with my panini as I am a fan of them. The shots arrived with what I can only describe as hostility. The waiter looked us up and down as he slapped the shots down. He left, and then he was back and said in an accusatory tone - ""WHO ordered the mushy peas?!"" I raised my hand, quivering in fear, and said ""why, that would be me good fellow!"" He frowned and said, ""are you sure? Are you sure you didn't post your table number on social media?"" I do not have social media as my Google account and my reviewing career takes up a lot of my time. He demanded again to see our 'story'. I was absolutely flabbergasted. My friend refused and insisted we had done no such thing. The waiter then said ""someone is taking the piss"", and walked off. My peas NEVER turned up after that. Moral of the story? Social media has corrupted our young people, customer service is just not up to scratch these days, and I shall never be returning to a Spoons of Wether's again. Unless they give me a complimentary tuna and mushy pea panini. I understand it takes a while to mush a good pea so, I will be waiting with bated breath.",2,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

The filter coffee is a refill affair, cost ¬£1.29 and FREE refills util 2pm, clearly aimed at business meetings and office workers. They serve breakfast until 12 pm when the menu changed on Wednesday to Chicken Day but each day has a different special.

The breakfasts looked great going by, but it were only 8:30am I had protein Porrige, so bit soon.

The staff were fine with me and the person I were with ordering 2 Coffees, and later 1 alcoholic drink.

There were large bottles of tartar sauce, tomato, brown and mustard all heinz I believe on each table, along with a deal (breakfast / chicken) menu and a normal menu which are large with food and drink prices both on it.

I didn't eat on this occasion, mostly because I drank soooooo much coffee and caffeine that I could see the music and feel the lights. The food all looked good even if not to my taste.

The toilets were clean and decent, ladies downstairs, along with a baby changing room and gents upstairs.

Michael Astley,9 years ago,1,"Breakfast was a challenge.

If I cook a breakfast at home and things go wrong, I don't mind too much having to pick about in it to find the edible bits. I do mind having to do that when I've paid for the breakfast as happened at this Wetherspoons last week.

The sausage and toast were the only things on the plate that were decent. Yes, bacon should be crispy - I won't eat bacon that flops around on the plate but this went too far in other direction.  It was rock hard. When I bit into it and heard a crack, there was a moment when I had to check whether it was the bacon or my tooth.

And the only explanation for the condition of the egg is that they simply forgot to cook it. I'm not fussy about fried eggs. I have a preference for how I like them but I'm quite happy to eat them just about any way they come, as long as they're cooked. When the yolk is totally runny and the white is half runny and is still clear in parts, I simply can't eat it.

All of this might have been more tolerable had the barman displayed at least the most rudimentary of social/service skills. I find morning to be the best part of the day and I really don't understand when friends say they can't function in the morning, so maybe I'm being a little unfair to the guy, but it should at least be possible to force a smile.

Your drinks will arrive much more quickly! Rules on children have gone out of the window, family area not enforced.

Sue,a month ago,5,"Wetherspoons in Manchester offers a quintessential British pub experience that's both familiar and comforting. Whether you're a local looking for a relaxed evening or a traveler seeking a taste of British hospitality, this establishment has something to offer.

One of the standout features of Wetherspoons is its extensive and budget-friendly menu. From hearty breakfast options to classic pub fare like fish and chips, burgers, and curries, there's a wide variety of dishes to choose from. The affordability here makes it a popular choice for a casual meal or a quick bite with friends.

The pub's interior exudes a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The traditional d√©cor, including wood-paneled walls and vintage artwork, adds to the charm. Whether you prefer a quiet corner to enjoy a pint or a lively spot to watch a sports match, Wetherspoons has the space to accommodate various preferences.

Speaking of pints, the drink selection is impressive, with a wide range of beers, ales, ciders, and cocktails on offer. The pub often features local and regional brews, allowing you to explore a taste of Manchester's beer culture.

Service at Wetherspoons is generally efficient, with staff ready to take your orders at the table or the bar. It's a no-frills approach that suits the relaxed pub environment.

One thing to keep in mind is that Wetherspoons can get quite busy during peak hours, and the noise level can rise accordingly. However, this adds to the vibrancy and social atmosphere, especially if you're looking to mingle with locals and fellow visitors.

In conclusion, Wetherspoons in Manchester provides a classic British pub experience with its affordable menu, cozy ambiance, and a wide range of drink options. Whether you're stopping by for a hearty meal, a few pints, or simply to soak in the local pub culture, it delivers a satisfying and enjoyable experience.",4,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,5,5,5,Not found

ejanke9,3 months ago,5,"Writing this just after I‚Äôve left the Weatherspoons as I‚Äôm so impressed with the service I received from Employee Kiera.

Been to this weatherspoons multiple times with my gf and the atmosphere is always so chill and friendly, even if it is sometimes a bit busy.

With my gf being out of town she wanted to treat me to a dessert so ordered online using my table number. In the last mouthful of the ice cream I had there was a tiny thin sheet of what seemed like plastic in it, I can only assume from the ice cream tub or something similar that had chipped into it. I took it out of my mouth and set it aside to inform the staff, not really bothered as I‚Äôve never had any issues before in my many visits.

As Kiera was going by I got her attention to inform her and let her know about the plastic but also let her know I‚Äôm not too bothered about it as I‚Äôd already eaten the full thing and it was in the last bite. Kiera showed amazing hospitality skills immediately acknowledging the issue and informing her manager straight away whilst apologising. I was then refunded for the dessert at the counter, my gf being the one who ordered online and not being present not being an issue as I had the order number, and was apologised to again.

I was so impressed with how she handled the issue and took control of the situation. Kiera is an absolute star and should be commended for her work!",2,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,5,5,5,Not found

As the night progressed I noticed he was working non stop doing the same thing ,and also serving on. I managed to catch his eye and told him what a good job he was doing,and so refreshing to see.

My eyesight is not good and I therefore don't like using  coffee machines , and was not pre-advised of this , so I decide to forego the  coffee - it wasn't expensive -- some you win some you lose. But then breakfast arrived -- the  food was barely warm , bordering  on cold , and the  plate had not being pre-warmed to keep the  food hot . I went to the  bar to explain the  food was cold and  I would rather  expect  the  food to be hot .  Staff member was very pleasant and said she would get me another breakfast , and she walked over to my table to took the food away.   A few minutes later , second  breakfast arrived -- younger
staff member who looked like  he was still at  school  EXACTLY the  SAME !!  COLD FOOD I suspect the kitchen keeps  certain quantities of sausages , bacon , hash browns, beans etc already cooked and placed in "" kept warm""  containers .At this point  I was fuming and knowing that if I spoke to the staff I might become more than a bit annoyed ,  I decided to just leave the food on the  table  , got up and  left,  Absolutely  disgusted that they do  not  know  how  to  serve  hot food !

The place was bedlam - incredibly loud (it was late Saturday afternoon) and there were groups of already quite drunk men shouting and singing and laughing at each other across the pub like it was a terrace. Using the app to order was a mistake as our food arrived fairly quickly, but our drinks did not. We asked a member of staff who said they were very busy. The staff probably were, but the pub was not full by any means, it was understaffed. We waited and ate and asked another member of staff who went away and a moment later a young man, obviously quite begrudgingly brought our drinks just in time for us to finish eating. It was a loud, dirty, poorly looked after place. Some staff are clearly trying hard to do what is expected of them, some less so. The fact that Wetherspoons isn't full on a Saturday afternoon says something. The fact we were foolish enough to give them our money says something else.

Thomas M√ºthing (theviolinproject.de),a year ago,4,"This JDW pub is simply named ""Wetherspoons"", no catchy name  attached. It's right opposite of Piccadilly Gardens, and barely 10 minutes on foot from Piccadilly Station. A large ""Spoon"" with a simple layout: One big room, with a slightly elevated are usually reserved for people who also want to eat there - in fact you can eat anywhere as long as you can find a free table. And that can be rather tricky during peak times.
Speaking of food: While the dishes are the same at all the Wetherspoon pubs, prices vary between individual pubs (usually, the food is more expensive at metropolitan Spoons). There's always a rotating selection of inexpensive cask ales available, and generally every variety of alcoholic drinks imaginable - at the lowest prices in Britain. The interior of this particular Spoon isn't as grubby as some, but not as stylish as others. It's pretty much your middle-of-the-road, average JDW pub. If you're looking for a nicer cask ale pub, head down Portland Street, you'll find several - with more expensive and not necessarily better beers on tap. ;)",605,5234,True,3,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1jRLwtyOgVd9cN2MkERAiKbuv5Sim4h90S5Hp=w450-h675-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqXSXLxlki3QSrS5VYh2VidWWHkCGnIAeDT93N=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdKwI_p_BEW_aBRFdOm89eq4B5guNT5V5xWXnR=w450-h338-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
Robyn Payne Cooper,a year ago,1,"Im a 5‚Äô2 18 year old girl so you can imagine im not the strongest of people. On saturday night around 11pm I went into manchester to meet some friends who were already out drinking in this specific wetherspoons. I got to the door and security refused entry as they ‚Äúweren‚Äôt letting anyone else in‚Äù I let my friends know and one of the girls came out to let them know that I was with them and they had a seat and a drink ready for me. One of the security guards who was stood on his phone said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs great rlly good to know‚Äù the other security said ‚Äúyeah we‚Äôre still not letting anyone in‚Äù. One of the guys on the door then proceeded to let this other lad in right in front of me, I had to stand outside alone for 10 minutes whilst my friends quickly finished their drinks. I would understand if I was in a group and they were refusing entry but I think it‚Äôs disgusting that they would let me stand outside alone when my friends were clearly already inside. If I could rate lower I definitely would. Highly recommend you get new door staff with better people skills",4,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

There are quite a few ales on sale and at reasonable prices for Manchester. I had some food there and all the food was very good and well worth the money. We used the app to order,with the table number, really very easy and no need to go to the bar. The service was excellent, staff very friendly. You can sit in or out depending on weather. Well worth a visit. I Don t give spoons enough consideration for a 5, mainly because they are so very good and I m waiting for one to be exceptional.

Neve Robinson,3 years ago,1,"Absolutely awful experience here in Spoons. We ordered on the app; just wraps and paninis, and our order took at least 45 minutes. We were informed there was no tuna - despite the fact I paid for that and simply had to have cheese and tomato instead. To compensate for this they sent over a cheap and unpleasant tasting can of a fizzy pop. I'm a diabetic so it felt like  a direct, targeted threat on my life just because I complained at the lack of tuna. Then, my friends decided to order 4 apple shots, and I ordered some mushy peas to go with my panini as I am a fan of them. The shots arrived with what I can only describe as hostility. The waiter looked us up and down as he slapped the shots down. He left, and then he was back and said in an accusatory tone - ""WHO ordered the mushy peas?!"" I raised my hand, quivering in fear, and said ""why, that would be me good fellow!"" He frowned and said, ""are you sure? Are you sure you didn't post your table number on social media?"" I do not have social media as my Google account and my reviewing career takes up a lot of my time. He demanded again to see our 'story'. I was absolutely flabbergasted. My friend refused and insisted we had done no such thing. The waiter then said ""someone is taking the piss"", and walked off. My peas NEVER turned up after that. Moral of the story? Social media has corrupted our young people, customer service is just not up to scratch these days, and I shall never be returning to a Spoons of Wether's again.

Outside the venue we spoke with bouncers who were working that morning, and even they didn't know what was the reason why me and my friends were told to leave, as none of us were too drunk neither we were behaving inappropriately.

Michael Astley,9 years ago,1,"Breakfast was a challenge.

If I cook a breakfast at home and things go wrong, I don't mind too much having to pick about in it to find the edible bits. I do mind having to do that when I've paid for the breakfast as happened at this Wetherspoons last week.

The sausage and toast were the only things on the plate that were decent. Yes, bacon should be crispy - I won't eat bacon that flops around on the plate but this went too far in other direction.  It was rock hard. When I bit into it and heard a crack, there was a moment when I had to check whether it was the bacon or my tooth.

And the only explanation for the condition of the egg is that they simply forgot to cook it. I'm not fussy about fried eggs. I have a preference for how I like them but I'm quite happy to eat them just about any way they come, as long as they're cooked. When the yolk is totally runny and the white is half runny and is still clear in parts, I simply can't eat it.

All of this might have been more tolerable had the barman displayed at least the most rudimentary of social/service skills. I find morning to be the best part of the day and I really don't understand when friends say they can't function in the morning, so maybe I'm being a little unfair to the guy, but it should at least be possible to force a smile.

Stretford Sue,3 years ago,2,"My friend and I visit this Wetherspoons occasionally and had our meal at the approx time of 6.30 - 6.45 p.m. yesterday 25th September 2020.

We were treating ourselves with a Girls night out and this was a disappointing start to the evening for us both.

I had the Fish and Chips with Peas priced at ¬£10 + ( we were not given a receipt, so not exactly sure about the price ) My friend had the Simple Steak.

The Simple Steak is a new item on the menu, we were told.

The Simple Steak came on the usual big blue Wetherspoons plates and consisted of very a small steak, and one very small baked potato and a small pot of sauce, nothing else.

It was a child-size portion and therefor overpriced at ¬£12

It was such a small-sized portion, that when a staff member did the customer 'check-back' we had to comment and complain, to him and also the Manager, who came over to us and who gave us the head office phone number so we could contact them directly and complain.

My friend and I are not ones to complain normally but with this 'meal' being such an overpriced meal we had to comment.

The staff were very polite and listened and agreed but said that the portion was correct as this is how the portion size is for this new item on the menu.

Both meals were served quickly and were nice and hot and tasted very good, no complaints there.

but I had a meal on my plate with the fish and chips I ordered but my friend a small snack, not a meal.
