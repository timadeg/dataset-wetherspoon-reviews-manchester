Martin Meggison,a month ago,1,"Well I decided to give this weatherspoons another go as every time I've been here it's been poor....so I wasn't surprised that our food order took 25 minutes to come bare in mind it is 9.45 am place was not at all to capacity, and compared to Middleton and Ashton where the staff the service and experience is so much more what you would expect staff happy to help and management like wise. But oldham is really poor avoid if you want food and friendly staff as this is none existent here. The steak shown was supposed to be well done and given the time it took from ordering to the table you think they could not mess this one up.......how wrong can someone be.

Cath Pearce,5 months ago,2,"Absolutely awful to be honest! We've been here loads of times just for drinks and been really happy, however, this time we met family for a nice meal, and were bitterly disappointed.
We all ordered food with a drink included, but two beers that we ordered had to be changed as it was off, the replacements were warm and flat tbh, and the shipyard beer was a glass full of froth that I was told would ""settle""! I've drunk shipyard many times and never experienced this!
After a forty minute wait for our food and empty glasses, we ordered wine, you can't go wrong with wine!  And asked where our food was? It was just on its way, whew! We were starving, we'd walked from Dukinfield for a pint and a pizza üçï. It was cold! We were so hungry that we ate a bit of it, there was no staff to voice our concerns to, as it was a family thing we sat there for quite sometime watching none of the tables being cleared, plates and glasses were building up everywhere and people were coming in and walking out because they were not happy at the state of the tables.
