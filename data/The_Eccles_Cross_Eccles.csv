Matthew Galatis,2 years ago,1,"I'm normally a big fan of wetherspoons and have never had a bad experience, however, today that all changed.

I ordered scrambled eggs on toast and upon receiving them I was disappointed to receive luke warm scrambled eggs that were hards and crunchy to touch, with slight discoloration. They certainly weren't fresh.

When I spoke to one of the ladies, I'm unsure of her name but she had pink hair, about this issue, she was very rude and abrupt, making out as if I was a liar when I mentioned the food not being fresh. I asked to see the chef and for her to leave the food behind so I could show it to the chef, but she rudely ignored this request and took the food away, as if to quickly get it out of sight of other customers. She did however get the chef, who while friendlier, denied the food being of poor standards.

Upon going to get my refund from the bar, I was only given ¬£1.30 of my ¬£3.19 for the meal (Which was extremely expensive for what was received, see pictures). When I questioned this, the lady said 'it's how refunds work'(????). After pressing the issue of how refunds are supposed to  work (You get the whole amount...) she admitted that she made a mistake and gave me the full refund.

I love Wetherspoons but this was an absolutely appalling experience that makes me unsure that I will ever return to this specific one ever again. A change of management is surely due.",1,2,False,2,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrdze2fOPW9d4Pkbtj_FAuWy7DVkbi4MjLl4jF=w450-h675-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkxh8bQgmf58uOwFiU_apPWlkjQQFSJLR6QmM7=w450-h675-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

SAD,6 years ago,1,"I have been in this pub a handful of times and every experience has been worse than the last. I understand they have policys to follow but in this case they need to make it effective and consitant, basically from my experience last night they are happy to serve achol to people without asking for id before 10 but at half past 10 it's a different story. (They even said they wernt not allow people in the pub after 10 without Id). Again the time was 10.30pm.

My most recent experience I had gone to meet a few work friends who had been in there since 8 being served jugs and achol drinks ect ... I arrived a little after 10 had a talk with the girls first and decided I would get a drink around 10.20pm as usual I got asked to provide my (I'd) which I did and a friend who again had previously been served was also asked for id even though she explained that she had been there since 8 and been servered by this woman shortly before. And was not buying a drink she still needed (id). After explainig she left it at home we returned to the table and explain what happened and we were asked to leave. My friends decided to finish the drinks they had already payed for and we were leaving.

Not even 5 minutes had passed for them to have chance to finish their drinks a very rude gentle man who works for the pub, came over telling us very abruptly to leave as we had failed to provide (id) after explaining that we had been asked to show Id he accused myself of not showing it to which I responded I did show this he then accused another of not having there's who again shown their (I'd). With this we were all asked to leave for again NOT PROVIDEING PROOF OF AGE! This was not the case. (As a group of ADULTS who were having a catch up and keeing quiet not causing or miver. Only 1 of us did not infact have (id) as she had forgotton it) My friends then said we are leaving after they have finished the drinks they had purched.

What absolutely discusting service. As a customer I felt the staff were rude and handled the situation badly it was not professional and given my friend has already been in there 2 and a half hours before they decided this rule it seems to me that their policy's are kind of a shambles. They were quick enough to take the money and had no problems, but then had conflict about my friends finishing what they (PAYED) for.",15,30,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

However our friend who was with us ordered a Pepsi max minutes after us and it arrived no problem. When the food arrived 20 minutes later we found that we had no onion rings or coleslaw which the menu clearly states should come with ribs and chips. Our friend ordered the same with bacon and cheese as an extra - the bacon and cheese were there but he had half the number of ribs we did.

I ordered scrambled eggs on toast and upon receiving them I was disappointed to receive luke warm scrambled eggs that were hards and crunchy to touch, with slight discoloration. They certainly weren't fresh.

When I spoke to one of the ladies, I'm unsure of her name but she had pink hair, about this issue, she was very rude and abrupt, making out as if I was a liar when I mentioned the food not being fresh. I asked to see the chef and for her to leave the food behind so I could show it to the chef, but she rudely ignored this request and took the food away, as if to quickly get it out of sight of other customers. She did however get the chef, who while friendlier, denied the food being of poor standards.

Upon going to get my refund from the bar, I was only given ¬£1.30 of my ¬£3.19 for the meal (Which was extremely expensive for what was received, see pictures). When I questioned this, the lady said 'it's how refunds work'(????). After pressing the issue of how refunds are supposed to  work (You get the whole amount...) she admitted that she made a mistake and gave me the full refund.

SAD,6 years ago,1,"I have been in this pub a handful of times and every experience has been worse than the last. I understand they have policys to follow but in this case they need to make it effective and consitant, basically from my experience last night they are happy to serve achol to people without asking for id before 10 but at half past 10 it's a different story. (They even said they wernt not allow people in the pub after 10 without Id). Again the time was 10.30pm.

My most recent experience I had gone to meet a few work friends who had been in there since 8 being served jugs and achol drinks ect ... I arrived a little after 10 had a talk with the girls first and decided I would get a drink around 10.20pm as usual I got asked to provide my (I'd) which I did and a friend who again had previously been served was also asked for id even though she explained that she had been there since 8 and been servered by this woman shortly before. And was not buying a drink she still needed (id). After explainig she left it at home we returned to the table and explain what happened and we were asked to leave. My friends decided to finish the drinks they had already payed for and we were leaving.

Not even 5 minutes had passed for them to have chance to finish their drinks a very rude gentle man who works for the pub, came over telling us very abruptly to leave as we had failed to provide (id) after explaining that we had been asked to show Id he accused myself of not showing it to which I responded I did show this he then accused another of not having there's who again shown their (I'd). With this we were all asked to leave for again NOT PROVIDEING PROOF OF AGE! This was not the case. (As a group of ADULTS who were having a catch up and keeing quiet not causing or miver. Only 1 of us did not infact have (id) as she had forgotton it) My friends then said we are leaving after they have finished the drinks they had purched.

What absolutely discusting service. As a customer I felt the staff were rude and handled the situation badly it was not professional and given my friend has already been in there 2 and a half hours before they decided this rule it seems to me that their policy's are kind of a shambles. They were quick enough to take the money and had no problems, but then had conflict about my friends finishing what they (PAYED) for.",15,30,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
