I have travelled the country working away from home and have always used Spoons whenever possible for my sustenance because of the value for money they offer and have never had a problem until visiting this establishment.
First week I ordered the madras on the curry night and was asked if I wanted the option that included the mango chutney popadoms onion barji and nan bread which I opted for. When it came there was no mango chutney (which is still the case 3 weeks after) and the onion barji was totally cremated to the point it was inedible. I returned both mine and my colleagues asking the lady serving for replacements which we could eat and also enquired where the mango chutney was. The manager came over and said there was no chutney and informed us that the onion barjis were ""coming out like that"". He offered a 70p refund for the onion barji but nothing for the lack of mango chutney. When he returned with the 70p he slammed it on the table and walked of with no apology for the bad experience.

Trying to pick up the bacon on a fork was rather like trying to pick a piece of paper up by sticking a fork in it. Impossible. Anyone who frequents Wetherspoons knows what to expect. It's cheap, so we get what we pay for. But this morning's bacon was even thinner than usual.

mark smith,a year ago,5,"Stopped for something to eat and drink before going to 02 Victoria warehouse
Nice little pub belonging to the weatherspoon chain..
Cheap beer.. Cheap pub food with a great atmosphere..
What Moor do you want..
The place was very busy being a Friday night but we were able to find a table.. Used the weather spoon app for ordering food and drinks..
Got served within minutes of ordering..
Drinks first and then food not long after
The food was enjoyable enough and for the price it was more than value for money
Toilets were on the second floor with a disabled toilet on the ground floor..
From what I saw.. You have to ask behind the bar for the key..
For sure worth a visit and the staff are friendly and polite.. Which can make all the difference..",399,4378,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
