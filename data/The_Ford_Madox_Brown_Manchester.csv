Gaizka N,3 months ago,4,"This Wetherspoon pub is just like any other in the franchise, offering the same familiar experience. The main difference is that this location might be slightly smaller than usual. However, what sets this place apart is the fantastic prices. I was able to enjoy a full English breakfast for an incredible ¬£2.99, and I doubt anyone can beat that value. If you're looking for a budget-friendly meal without compromising on taste, this Wetherspoon pub is a great choice. The wide selection of food and drinks at such affordable prices make it a go-to spot for a satisfying meal.",290,2363,True,4,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWxtLn7JcUmSv_yZLVRyCLG0OI7x9s3uJXMes=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl0jbupZj9eTHtf1bKlVZspWnJfD7LWm-4fVk=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtU8nytzwUnWVwbOyOdxZqJNdFjHAhvYnCmJo=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqvwDIOZS1mgauECAEL3D-DXgRSuguowEduMA=w450-h338-p-k-no",¬£1‚Äì10,3,5,4,Not found

Simon McCabe,a month ago,3,"Well. Where to start. So, the place looks nice inside. Dark, presumably so you can't see too closely.
The nuggets where surprisingly very tasty, the burger has tiny and dry. We shared the loaded fries, they could have been better, the cheese was barely melted and lacked flavour. The halloumi was a bit overdone but was also quite cold on arrival.
Staff seemed quite nice, although rushed.
The place was letdown by the stereotypical spoons crowd.
People pushing in, arguing with each other and a delightful couple who seemed close to good old fisticuffs. That might be your type of thing, but not mine.",196,835,True,0,,¬£10‚Äì20,3,4,2,"Beef Burger, Chips"

Lord Neville JP Edwards Rennalls,2 years ago,5,"What an absolute delight it was to stop off here on the off chance to then be greeted by beautiful attentive staff, in a classically decorated modern bar. Drinks so reasonably priced but the melt in the mouth, medium rare steak with fluffy thick cut chips topped with a homemade pepper corn sauce. It's a basic meal made exceptionally by the way its prepared. I've eaten some expensive steaks but for somewhere you would think is run of the mill, taking the chance you won't be disappointed. After a morning of shear running around to be pleasantly satisfied with the simplicity of decent well cooked standard food has made my week. I would recommend this venue to anyone looking for no fuss but inviting environment with great staff and above standard food.

Sammy,8 months ago,1,"I visited your pub and was appalled by the service demonstrated by the manger on duty.

We ordered our food around 6:10pm and was told by our server that there was a 25 minute wait on food which was fine. We had a gig to go to for 7pm but didn‚Äôt mind being a little late.

After waiting 40 minutes and no sign of our food I decided to try to find out how long it would be. I asked the manager on duty who was serving drinks behind the bar. Before I could say anything he rudely said ‚ÄòIf you want to know how long your food will be there is a 30 minute wait on food. I told him but ours was over 40 minutes and he abruptly chimed in with ‚ÄòI said at LEAST 30 minutes.‚Äô I said can you find out how long it will take and his response was No all he can see is the information on the screen. I asked if he couldn‚Äôt just go and speak to the kitchen to find out as all I wanted was a rough eta. He then rudely went ‚ÄòFine‚Äô. After returning  his responses was ‚ÄòAbout 5 minutes could be less could be more‚Äô.

Our food arrived about 2 minutes later. I did have to return with my burger as there was no tennesse sauce with it. We ate the food which was Luke warm at best but after the unhelpful manner from the manager we didn‚Äôt bother complaining as we lost all faith in him.

Please could you respond with what action will be taken to make sure customers aren‚Äôt treated so rudely.

Nathaniel Marsh,4 years ago,1,"This has got to be the worst wetherspoons I have ever been to. We came on a Sunday morning, after a night out on the lash, and were welcomed by a few spice heads hanging out around the entrance. When you walk through the door you will feel your vitamin D levels reduce as you enter the dark red painted pub, with not a window in sight. It really does make you wonder who decided to paint such a small and dark space with such a dark colour. We ordered food and waiter seemed to have lost his voice. Whispering people's orders audible to, I'm sure, those only equip with the strongest hearing aids. When the food came it really wasn't worth the wait, with everyone's chips having a strange eggy taste to them. It really wasn't my cup of tea, but it clearly seemed to do it for some people.

Craig Hardy,10 months ago,1,"They would rather put glasses on the shelves here, leaving a customer waiting at the bar seems normal pratice. Self absorbed staff and Olivia the Manager hasn't a clue about hospitality or customer service. Dreadful experience üò™ This place is not doing wetherspoons proud at all. Regular spoons attendee btw, and work a bar myself. Shockingly bad. If you don't care about how your treated as a paying customer, you should go here. üëéüèª",7,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
