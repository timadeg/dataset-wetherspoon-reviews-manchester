Rob Gough,2 weeks ago,3,"I went for coffee at breakfast time. I don't recall going to this branch of 'Spoons before, fairly sure I haven't.

The staff were pleasant. It was fairly early in the morning, so I wasn't expecting much of an atmosphere.

Unusually, I wasn't really up for looking at the wall prints that usually tell the history of the pub and the locality.

Tony McGuire,4 weeks ago,2,"Since a change in management this place has taken a nosedive. I‚Äôve been to eat 3 times and been disappointed every time & this is why‚Ä¶
- breakfast; we were told they had run out of sausage. There are several supermarkets selling sausages nearby, could they not send staff out to get some and when I suggested this the staff just laughed at me but did add an extra rasher.
It came with a thimble size portion of beans and one very soggy mushroom.
Very poor !

Afternoon - ordered meal and told
‚Äúno chips as fryer broken‚Äù

Evening - ordered chicken burger and it tasted disgusting like disinfectant, staff not that interested in a refund & reluctantly replaced the burger

I'm only commenting on my own order.
The chips tasted a little wrong to me but that maybe my personal opinion the sausage was over cooked and the amount of beans I got given was maybe just over a table spoon full üò¢ the fried egg I got was not even done properly and my daughter said I should send it back but I didn't want to waste my time so I never touched the egg at all üòí and my bacon must've been in the pan for the whole of 20 seconds. Then put in the microwave for 10-20 seconds because it was still pink and was still cold when I received it.

Buy 2 to save queuing again. 12.30 people are leaving but nobody is clearing tables. New customers leaving because of queues and dirty tables.

The problem? SHORTAGE OF STAFF.
Manager declines offer to help from off duty member of staff. Unbelievable.
Suspect real problem is corporate mentality of cutting staffing budgets at the expense of quality of service. False economy. The football team alone would have paid the wages of an extra bar person.

colinley,4 years ago,1,"I've eaten 3 times at this weatherspoons and 3 times it's been terrible. First time I ordered a chicken curry when it came out I tried to cut the whole chicken breast that was in the curry sauce. But it was that hard I couldn't even put my fork into it. Never mind cut it or eat it. When I complained about it they offerd to replace just the chicken breast. I told them that wasn't good enough. They reluctantly changed the whole meal.

The second time was for a Christmas get together of around 20 friends. Again the food was terrible like someone had gone to Iceland and chucked it in the oven. And the desert was a joke we had 2 tiny bowls with a few small chocolate brownies in between 20 people I'd have said it was only enough for 4 people max.

And the latest was this evening.
I ordered a LARGE Mixed grill. I was asked how I like my steak cooked I replied rare. As soon as it came out I was disappointed with the presentation. And the cuts of meat were the tiniest I have ever seen on a mixed grill. I don't know why they bothered to ask how I wanted my steak cooked. Because it was all like lumps of charcoal.

I have always enjoyed meals at other weatherspoons such as the punch bowl in York. Fantastic breakfast and excellent mixed grill. But I will never eat in the gateway again. I've finally learnt my lesson",10,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

- breakfast; we were told they had run out of sausage. There are several supermarkets selling sausages nearby, could they not send staff out to get some and when I suggested this the staff just laughed at me but did add an extra rasher.
It came with a thimble size portion of beans and one very soggy mushroom.
Very poor !

Afternoon - ordered meal and told
‚Äúno chips as fryer broken‚Äù

Big pub so you're not on top of each other too like these new places are now.  We really enjoyed it.  I got a pasta dish as I'd fancied Italian,  my mate got fish n chips,  her all-time favourite and my Grandson had a burger so all 3 of us got what we wanted in a lovely warm inviting pub.

just like everywhere else they provide a table service and that was a shambles, the team delivering the drinks spent the entire time with their backs to the clientele chatting to the team behind the bar. the only way you could order a drink other than by the app was walking up to the bar and asking, several tables were complaining hardly the best practice in the current environment!!..really poor guys..not what you expect from a big company",5,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

colinley,4 years ago,1,"I've eaten 3 times at this weatherspoons and 3 times it's been terrible. First time I ordered a chicken curry when it came out I tried to cut the whole chicken breast that was in the curry sauce. But it was that hard I couldn't even put my fork into it. Never mind cut it or eat it. When I complained about it they offerd to replace just the chicken breast. I told them that wasn't good enough. They reluctantly changed the whole meal.

The second time was for a Christmas get together of around 20 friends. Again the food was terrible like someone had gone to Iceland and chucked it in the oven. And the desert was a joke we had 2 tiny bowls with a few small chocolate brownies in between 20 people I'd have said it was only enough for 4 people max.

And the latest was this evening.
I ordered a LARGE Mixed grill. I was asked how I like my steak cooked I replied rare. As soon as it came out I was disappointed with the presentation. And the cuts of meat were the tiniest I have ever seen on a mixed grill. I don't know why they bothered to ask how I wanted my steak cooked. Because it was all like lumps of charcoal.

I have always enjoyed meals at other weatherspoons such as the punch bowl in York. Fantastic breakfast and excellent mixed grill. But I will never eat in the gateway again. I've finally learnt my lesson",10,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

steve haworth,6 years ago,1,"Sunday. 12 o'clock on the dot. Place is rammed. Every table taken with people eating.  Massive queue at bar. One person behind the bar, occasionally 2. 12.15 finally served but told of 45 min wait for food. Decline the food and stick to drinks. Buy 2 to save queuing again. 12.30 people are leaving but nobody is clearing tables. New customers leaving because of queues and dirty tables. Football team arrives - 12 lads all starving and thirsty - and sit at dirty table hoping it will be cleaned but leave when they hear the delay in food service. 1pm.  More customers having to clean their own tables. Several regulars complaining of late, cold food.
The problem? SHORTAGE OF STAFF.
Manager declines offer to help from off duty member of staff. Unbelievable.
Suspect real problem is corporate mentality of cutting staffing budgets at the expense of quality of service. False economy. The football team alone would have paid the wages of an extra bar person. And the loss of goodwill is priceless if the conversation of the regulars next to me is anything to go by. 1.15. I'm off. Will I come back?

Joe Shepherd,4 years ago,2,"Visited here with my daughter who is 19 to get something to eat. I ordered the small brunch which has sausage, egg, bacon, beans and chips. My daughter ordered a chicken burger with chips.
I'm only commenting on my own order.
The chips tasted a little wrong to me but that maybe my personal opinion the sausage was over cooked and the amount of beans I got given was maybe just over a table spoon full üò¢ the fried egg I got was not even done properly and my daughter said I should send it back but I didn't want to waste my time so I never touched the egg at all üòí and my bacon must've been in the pan for the whole of 20 seconds. Then put in the microwave for 10-20 seconds because it was still pink and was still cold when I received it. So if you ask for the same as me ask for them to at least make sure your egg is cooked and the bacon is at least warm.

We then ordered via the app, which worked well, and was simple to do.

Sam T,5 years ago,3,"Nice as far as spoons go. I some times go for the cocktail jugs which are a reasonably cheap drink if you fancy cosy surroundings but if they're out of one of the mixers, some staff are more than happy to accommodate and substitute with something else, others like to flex their position and refuse completely at which point I left.
