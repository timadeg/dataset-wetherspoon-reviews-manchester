Maggie Savidge,3 months ago,5,"It was quite busy when we arrived so struggled to find an empty table. Had to ask for it to be cleaned when we ordered, which it was, promptly. Food was lovely and very reasonably priced. Staff were pleasant, polite and helpful. Could do with more choice for deserts.
As it's in city centre Manchester there is no parking available. The entrance is wheelchair friendly but most of the tables on ground floor level were very high with bar stool type chairs so wouldn't be suitable for anyone in a wheelchair. The main menu is extensive with lots of vegetarian options. There are a few tables and chairs outside, but under cover. Didn't see any children whilst we were there, nor a children's menu.",402,3482,True,4,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAPb_vMuNxNPJMkyzcBoZNNvgQKkWPLEeug4X_=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_9VF2w5al8vVt6T1G7vV_lATVgD8YlOGMvjDj=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUQEFjRSj3q3-Qy4XZ5k0Gf79M6RuNbeAunpH0=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZerI0b5r6xCdagtpt1DlXdgYUi6XwTfnaXErd=w450-h338-p-k-no",£10–20,5,5,4,Onion Rings

Friendly staff.
Clean and tidy place to eat, as we're the toilets once you've climbed all the stairs lol.
Food was lovely and reasonably priced.
Would love to visit again and would recommend to family and friends.
Nice name also.
Bus service runs close by as does the trams.
If your staying at Manchester Central it's just round the corner.
Not sure if they had accessible toilet but they did have accessible entrance

The food at this spoons upon my visit took a shockingly long (for spoons) 35 minutes to arrive! My chicken breast bites dipped in sticky soy sauce tasted the same as the last 16 times I've had them when they arrived, though.
I gave the atmosphere 5/5. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the worst 'atmospheres' I've experienced. However, it's a 5/5 spoons atmosphere. Plenty of after work warriors and a table of ladies sharing a bottle of wine from an ice bucket.
Service has to be a 5 for me. Served quickly at the bar AND, because I agreed to take a pint of Stowford Press (one they had poured about 3 minutes before i ordered mine)off their hands, I got a pint of Stowford Press for one pound something.

Anne-Marie Jagger,a year ago,1,My son went into the bar today with his step dad. He had been really excited to go in for his 16th birthday.  The excitement ended at the bar. My son has significant learning disabilities and is focussed on certain things like finding out what kind of hoover they use in the bar. On asking the barman this question he was met with a dirty look and told it’s not my job to tell you what hoover is here.  My son did not understand as people are usually more friendly. His step dad was upset and voiced this to the bar man and was met with the response that if he isn’t happy security will deal with him. Honestly the most appalling attitude and an extremely poor representation of Manchester and what Mancunians are really like. I hope management read this and address this with the bartender. Definitely not a place to go if you want to experience true Mancunian hospitality. I have had to put a star or I can’t post.

Jon Conroy,2 years ago,3,"This is yet another Wetherspoons in Manchester City Center. If you've been in one then you've been in another, and it's the same here too apart from one large difference. That is how large it is. I have been told this is the largest Wetherspoons in the UK  (this can be Googled, but I'll leave that up to you to do if you want to know - having seem it I'm happy to believe it).

There are two floors with huge bars on each of them - however there are only toilets on the top floor.

The drinks menu is nothing special by any stretch - I couldn't get a stout other than Guinness - but there are all the usual suspects otherwise including cocktails, so although CAMRA won't be recommending this place any time soon.

Food - again standard finger type food. Chicken wings, chicken bites with dips. These were pretty tasty actually but the garlic bread on the other hand was way under cooked. Really put me and ever one in our group off eating it. It wasn't raw, just... Sloppy...

The reason I decided to add review for yet another Wetherspoons when a review of one is enough for any is the size.

Staff were totally focussed on the new TV screen showing orders via the mobile phone App, and were ignoring the queue at the bar and avoiding eye contact with punters who had been waiting 10 mins.  Bar Service has gone downhill. If you are not using their Mobile phone App to order, then you will have to wait. On the positive side,  I did (eventually manage)to order food and it was excellent.
My Friday night visit was ruined after the food though. Wetherspoons are famous for their "" no music or TV policy- because it destroys conversation"" well in this venue this Wetherspoons policy does not seem to apply, as they cleared the floor of chairs & tables at 8pm (on a Friday night) for some unwelcome/ unwanted music. Customers who were spending money and enjoying conversation were moved out so a DJ could play loud music! Which made conversation impossible. There's a hundred venues in Manchester providing this nonsense for those who like it, so why are Spoons doing this? An absolutely terrible commercial decision. Totally ruined the great atmosphere of the venue. My picture of an empty dance floor demonstrates what a pointless decision this was !!! Maybe 75 people left when the DJ started up his racket.

There wasn't even a long line of customers. We ended up leaving because the price of the drinks wasn't worth the lack of service. On the second occasion, yesterday a group of seven I was with was turned away because a friend of mine was wearing black nike tennis shoes (clean if I must say) with a pressed button down shirt and nice jeans. I found this to be ironic considering I wore something similar the last time I had visited (Maybe that's why I was never served). We asked the bouncer if the business were potentially okay with turning away $100(+) worth of drinks just because of one individual's pair of shoes. He replied, ""Yes, this is just me doing my job."" So his job is to turn away business? Bad decision I must say. I will never bring my colleagues or friends here again in the hopes that a business doesn't insult someone on their shoes.

The so called manager and his colleagues seemed to think the whole debacle was extremely humorous.

e B,2 weeks ago,4,"Let me preface with this: I'm a big spoons go-er, so I know what I'm in for when it comes to food, service, atmosphere.
The food at this spoons upon my visit took a shockingly long (for spoons) 35 minutes to arrive! My chicken breast bites dipped in sticky soy sauce tasted the same as the last 16 times I've had them when they arrived, though.
I gave the atmosphere 5/5. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the worst 'atmospheres' I've experienced. However, it's a 5/5 spoons atmosphere. Plenty of after work warriors and a table of ladies sharing a bottle of wine from an ice bucket.
Service has to be a 5 for me. Served quickly at the bar AND, because I agreed to take a pint of Stowford Press (one they had poured about 3 minutes before i ordered mine)off their hands, I got a pint of Stowford Press for one pound something.
Not my favourite spoons in the city, of course its not, but a trusty fueling up location nonetheless.",2,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,4,5,5,Not found

Joey O'Brien,4 months ago,1,"Spent a few hours there today, had a great time with some very nice food in the Manchester sun. Experience kind of ruined when a floor manager passed by the table and when clearing the table stuck his finger in my not empty bottle of cider, immediately apologised and said he'd replace. Waited a few minutes for this and saw him go back outside a few times, ignoring us. Asked him what the update was on the drink, he told me that it was empty and there was no replacement coming, after admitting at the table it wasn't and that he'd replace. Immediately left from there, so overall, good experience but one member of staff really dampened it, hopefully he can improve on the floor.",1,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,5,1,3,Not found

I was very happy with the great customer service and the cleanliness of the pub/restaurant.

Toilet facilities are clean and to a high standard.

The pub is massive, so works perfectly for socialising or for privacy if on your own.

Their is an outside eating and drinking area in front of the pub, where you can smoke and watch the busy crowds go by.

Anne-Marie Jagger,a year ago,1,My son went into the bar today with his step dad. He had been really excited to go in for his 16th birthday.  The excitement ended at the bar. My son has significant learning disabilities and is focussed on certain things like finding out what kind of hoover they use in the bar. On asking the barman this question he was met with a dirty look and told it’s not my job to tell you what hoover is here.  My son did not understand as people are usually more friendly. His step dad was upset and voiced this to the bar man and was met with the response that if he isn’t happy security will deal with him. Honestly the most appalling attitude and an extremely poor representation of Manchester and what Mancunians are really like. I hope management read this and address this with the bartender. Definitely not a place to go if you want to experience true Mancunian hospitality. I have had to put a star or I can’t post.

Dillon Marx,6 years ago,1,"I would give this establishment zero stars if I had the opportunity. I have visited this bar twice with friends. On the first occasion, it was not as busy and I found a table on the second floor. I then went to the bar staffed with two individuals where I waited for at least ten minutes. There wasn't even a long line of customers. We ended up leaving because the price of the drinks wasn't worth the lack of service. On the second occasion, yesterday a group of seven I was with was turned away because a friend of mine was wearing black nike tennis shoes (clean if I must say) with a pressed button down shirt and nice jeans. I found this to be ironic considering I wore something similar the last time I had visited (Maybe that's why I was never served). We asked the bouncer if the business were potentially okay with turning away $100(+) worth of drinks just because of one individual's pair of shoes. He replied, ""Yes, this is just me doing my job."" So his job is to turn away business? Bad decision I must say. I will never bring my colleagues or friends here again in the hopes that a business doesn't insult someone on their shoes.

Anissa Jameson,a year ago,2,"The pub itself is nice, with cheap drinks and food. We got the halloumi wrap, but unfortunately the halloumi was over cooked and tasted burnt.
But the worst bit for me was the disgusting state of the ladies toilets that absolutely stank of the overflowing sanitary bins in nearly every cubicle, just horrible.

Jon Conroy,2 years ago,3,"This is yet another Wetherspoons in Manchester City Center. If you've been in one then you've been in another, and it's the same here too apart from one large difference. That is how large it is. I have been told this is the largest Wetherspoons in the UK  (this can be Googled, but I'll leave that up to you to do if you want to know - having seem it I'm happy to believe it).

There are two floors with huge bars on each of them - however there are only toilets on the top floor.

The drinks menu is nothing special by any stretch - I couldn't get a stout other than Guinness - but there are all the usual suspects otherwise including cocktails, so although CAMRA won't be recommending this place any time soon.

Food - again standard finger type food. Chicken wings, chicken bites with dips. These were pretty tasty actually but the garlic bread on the other hand was way under cooked. Really put me and ever one in our group off eating it. It wasn't raw, just... Sloppy...

The reason I decided to add review for yet another Wetherspoons when a review of one is enough for any is the size.

David,3 years ago,3,"Always busy but service has gone downhill. Staff were totally focussed on the new TV screen showing orders via the mobile phone App, and were ignoring the queue at the bar and avoiding eye contact with punters who had been waiting 10 mins.  Bar Service has gone downhill. If you are not using their Mobile phone App to order, then you will have to wait. On the positive side,  I did (eventually manage)to order food and it was excellent.
My Friday night visit was ruined after the food though. Wetherspoons are famous for their "" no music or TV policy- because it destroys conversation"" well in this venue this Wetherspoons policy does not seem to apply, as they cleared the floor of chairs & tables at 8pm (on a Friday night) for some unwelcome/ unwanted music. Customers who were spending money and enjoying conversation were moved out so a DJ could play loud music! Which made conversation impossible. There's a hundred venues in Manchester providing this nonsense for those who like it, so why are Spoons doing this? An absolutely terrible commercial decision. Totally ruined the great atmosphere of the venue. My picture of an empty dance floor demonstrates what a pointless decision this was !!! Maybe 75 people left when the DJ started up his racket.
Get rid of the pointless unwanted DJ. !!! And please restore the opportunity to talk to people without competing with loud music.",215,23,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
