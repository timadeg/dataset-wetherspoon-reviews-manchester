Andrew Leeming,4 weeks ago,5,"It's a spoons. Adjust your expectations if getting food, but it is still good given the price. A reasonable place for an afternoon drink, even with small children or elderly relatives.

Angel Connell,a month ago,2,"We went for tea last night and it was steak night , we both ordered medium and they both came out burnt yes burnt, sent them back and they came back not much better but at least they were warm unlike the rest ofc the dish the chips, peas and onion rings all came back cold.
Having eating at Shay Wake numerous times and never had food as bad as this I’m wondering if its been a change of kitchen team as they need to bring the old team back looking around at other tables they was a lot of food left on other plates as well.
On the plus side the manager was really good and offered us a free drink and refunded us back the price of our meal.",1,No photos count,False,0,,£20–30,1,4,3,Not found

Elizabeth Campbell,a month ago,5,Totally different to up steps in oldham. Shay wake is the exact opposite to up steps. The food is served quickly and hot. The staff are pleasant and polite they are very helpfull and friendly. And the customers are not screaming and shouting. I highly recommend this pub. It has a big outside area I noticed lots of children in summer with their parents. The tables inside are very quickly cleaned of plates and glasses unlike upsteps you have to empty a table yourself before seating and I used baby wipes to clean it often.

My only complaint is that, apart from my sausages which were hot, everything else was lukewarm but the plate was cold so that wouldn't have helped. All in all very good and good value for money.

This put me off my eggs so i decided to leave them and eat everything else, all the other items were cold and the hash browns tasted of pure oil. wont be visiting here again as i dont like my food being grabbed by peoples bare hands.

Meg SP.,6 years ago,4,"The food is very good and cheap, nice drink sets. The service was average, we had to wait a long time for the table to be cleaned after the previous guests (it was so dirty that you couldn't sit at it without getting dirty). After three requests, the dishes were gone (but the Waitress didn't have a very positive attitude towards us). Overall, I highly recommend the food, minus the service and the not very clean place",82,220,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
