Camille D.,2 weeks ago,5,"Very nice place. We love going to Wetherspoon whenever we are in the UK as the food and drinks are cheap and the portions are great for the price.
We ate there several times including for breakfast. Love that they offer many vegan options and that they have oat milk available for your coffee / tea.
This Wetherspoon was quite crowded because of rugby games but overall was great.",123,143,True,0,,£10–20,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Enya,a year ago,1,"We had 10 people on our table to come in. All of us ordered on the app individually. It was very quiet Sunday lunch, not many people around. The food was terrible. Most of the food had obviously been cooked and just kept hot for hours waiting for someone to order it. My ‘mash potato’ was harder than a rock, and when asked for another the second was only marginally better but the bottom was still rock hard. The chilli sauce on most of my friends dishes were far too spicy even for the ones that liked spice, and when told about this there was no offer of replacement given by the staff, even though the 4 out of 10 that got the sauce said it was different to other spoons and it was definitely more spicy. 1 of the staff was very nice, the rest looked like they hated being there.

Lorna Joyce,a year ago,1,"Absolutely horrified with how we've been treated by the staff. Ordered three drinks to start with. A double rum, double disaranno and a double whiskey all accompanied by a cola absolutely fine, no garnish inside the drinks so presentation wasn't anything special. Once I ordered the second time with two of the same drinks so a double rum and double disaranno  they both came out with a lime garnish. After having one sip of the disaranno it wasn't the drink we ordered. Taking the drink back to the till to ask for it to be remade I was refused by the team leader to have it remade as their reply was it was correct. After challenging them the second time about not having the garnish in it on the first round and then it happens to have a garnish it in the second round his response was well the drink was made incorrectly the first time. Still not happy I asked for it to be remade without a garnish  again his response was that he will not remake the drink because his colleague said it was made correct. Again I just asked to have it remade as it does not taste like the drink is supposed to. He refused once more. Getting really irate at this point I got my boyfriend to talk to the team leader which was then diverted to the next manager in line. We were finally offered a refund for the drinks instead of just remaking the drink we wanted.",1,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

We orders 3 traditional breakfasts.
When we ordered they were ran out of sausages. So when we ordered we wanted 2 breakfasts normal and one without tomato and no beans and swapped for other items. The woman reading the order said it correctly.
We got out cutlery before the meal and when the waiter came she dropped it on the table as she walked past and the cutlery was crusty and disgusting.
However, when the order came, all there meals had no tomato and no beans and swapped for other items. We sent 2 back and we had to actually ask for them back with their added tomato and beans. When they came back, one was still wrong. By this point one person had finished their meal and was just sat there. The third meal came still without tomato but at this point we didn't care and just got on with it.
Overall, a disgraceful meal and we were offered no recompense for our ordeal.
We spoke to manager when he brought the meals when one was wrong and he didn't seem to care. Looking at past reviews they seem to go downhill after his employment.

Most of the food had obviously been cooked and just kept hot for hours waiting for someone to order it. My ‘mash potato’ was harder than a rock, and when asked for another the second was only marginally better but the bottom was still rock hard. The chilli sauce on most of my friends dishes were far too spicy even for the ones that liked spice, and when told about this there was no offer of replacement given by the staff, even though the 4 out of 10 that got the sauce said it was different to other spoons and it was definitely more spicy. 1 of the staff was very nice, the rest looked like they hated being there.

Im 60 years old and this was my first time out in 4 years, due to my disability and ill health so was really looking forward to going out with my Neice. After our lovely Dinner, we ordered a Desert and after 40 mins my neice enquired where it was. First told we had not ordered but showed my receipt to Mr Love, (staff) whose attitude towards my Neice was disgraceful, who still said we had not ordered. My neice disagreed with him at the bar, he came over to me said he was not serving us and asked me to leave immediately and dont come back!...Snatched our drinks away which we had just got!...i was so upset and embarrassed and hurt at the way this chap spoke to me and treated my neice and myself ! Disgusting behaviour from your Management.
I hope that his conduct is addressed and we receive an apology and refund for the Desert and drinks that I paid for but didnt have.
Awaiting response from Witherspoons.!

During my visit unfortunately they run out of almost all food on the menu which was slightly disappointing however I found that the service was fast when ordering through the app.

What you will find as in most places in Central Manchester the prices are inflated compared to other weatherspoons . -specifically the once in more rural areas will have much lower prices. This is an unfortunate but understandable downside, as the business has to pay more for rent and other associated costs with the location of the pub.

Lorna Joyce,a year ago,1,"Absolutely horrified with how we've been treated by the staff. Ordered three drinks to start with. A double rum, double disaranno and a double whiskey all accompanied by a cola absolutely fine, no garnish inside the drinks so presentation wasn't anything special. Once I ordered the second time with two of the same drinks so a double rum and double disaranno  they both came out with a lime garnish. After having one sip of the disaranno it wasn't the drink we ordered. Taking the drink back to the till to ask for it to be remade I was refused by the team leader to have it remade as their reply was it was correct. After challenging them the second time about not having the garnish in it on the first round and then it happens to have a garnish it in the second round his response was well the drink was made incorrectly the first time. Still not happy I asked for it to be remade without a garnish  again his response was that he will not remake the drink because his colleague said it was made correct. Again I just asked to have it remade as it does not taste like the drink is supposed to. He refused once more. Getting really irate at this point I got my boyfriend to talk to the team leader which was then diverted to the next manager in line. We were finally offered a refund for the drinks instead of just remaking the drink we wanted.",1,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Andrew Jones,3 years ago,1,"45 minute wait for food to arrive.

After our lengthy wait we were at least expecting the food to be hot - but no, it came out just warm.

Staff didn't seem very apologetic, in fact staff seem to have a problem with other ""customers"" too. One, who was wearing a shirt so I assume was a manager appeared to take issue with a customer who had just pointed out the reason his chair was in that location was because that is where it was when he arrived.

I'd suggest avoiding this establishment. It's a shame Weatherspoons seems to be going down hill these days.",44,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
Matthew Ashley,3 years ago,1,On the 19/12/19 I ordered the lamb Rogan Josh. The meal came out with the meat stone cold! I alerted a member of staff and requested a replacement dish. Roughly 10 minutes later my replacement arrived. Again with the meat cold! The staff member admitted the meat was cold. And tries to offer drinks as an apology. However for me public health can not be measured in drinks. After twice failing to warm the food correctly. It had clearly been micro waved. Even though the menu says slow cooked  very disappointed.

The desert came out very cold, I sent it back politely and the next order came back burnt. They had obviously over heated it because I sent the previous order back. Now I’m struggling to eat a burnt cookie dough desert because it’s all chewy and Rock hard at the bottom. Customers shouldn’t be treated like this, after all we are paying for the food.

Ben Naylor,4 years ago,1,"So we are a party of 3 who decided to go here for a breakfast as we know that weatherspoons is usually good for breakfasts.
We orders 3 traditional breakfasts.
When we ordered they were ran out of sausages. So when we ordered we wanted 2 breakfasts normal and one without tomato and no beans and swapped for other items. The woman reading the order said it correctly.
We got out cutlery before the meal and when the waiter came she dropped it on the table as she walked past and the cutlery was crusty and disgusting.
However, when the order came, all there meals had no tomato and no beans and swapped for other items. We sent 2 back and we had to actually ask for them back with their added tomato and beans. When they came back, one was still wrong. By this point one person had finished their meal and was just sat there. The third meal came still without tomato but at this point we didn't care and just got on with it.
Overall, a disgraceful meal and we were offered no recompense for our ordeal.
We spoke to manager when he brought the meals when one was wrong and he didn't seem to care. Looking at past reviews they seem to go downhill after his employment.

Would like to hear back from manager about possible recompense for this disgrace they tried to pass off as a meal.",9,5,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

I went to the bar 2 girls behind the bar one with light brown hair & another with darker/ black hair, who served me.
I’d been stood there ten minutes & a bloke came up & she served him first ,
I said I’ve been waiting mate,
She said well I don’t know who was first,
I said I wasn’t talking to you I was talking to the bloke who just pushed in ,
However her attitude was awful ,
I then sat down with the coffees ,
Somebody opened the kitchen door &
I heard somebody shout who’s fcuking ordered ice cream ?

Some of the staff are rather rude. A young blonde barmaid about 20 was very rude. I asked for a pint of beer and a pint of pepsi with a just a few cubes of ice and she filled the glass up to the top with ice. I said ""no! only a few cubes"" so she poured some ice still leaving half a glass full so i had to say again ""no just a few cubes!"" to which she angrily tipped all but 2 cubes out and held it up to me with a nasty look of ""that good enough for you!?"". Then with the beer the head was around an inch and a half but i couldn't be bothered with more attitude and just accepted it.

Colin Baker,3 years ago,4,"Argyle on tour! Having arrived at Manchester after a 7hr journey by train I toured the city for an hour or so booked into my hotel and then went to have a beer and some food before busing out to Salford city to watch the Argyle,  And the Seven Stars was the perfect venue.  Two floors and a nice chilled late afternoon and a pint of Ruddles for £1.29!!!! Yes 1.29. Girls behind the bar were very pleasant and when I moved upstairs and eventually ordered curry and chips and another pint the guy behind the bar unselfishly went downstairs to pull the pint and bring it upstairs. And all for just over a tenner. Not the best garlic naan bread in the world and the rice was a bit sticky but nevertheless good value. It was busy. And after we had beaten City I came back and celebrated with another pint and some nuts.....what a wonderful world it is....football, beer.....and Wetherspoons.....what else is there!!!!",443,1836,True,4,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMO2ONZPQT9S21-e6GW67jUhSczp5bBwKHG_SJ7=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXrglyZlan6a7SN6cc6Tp7BODXB1KgxJX08IRo=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPRkIra4JLOenRIFNuQ_jeHqN9icr5LgnnnTPo=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyJiGuzMXGhXq7DJAHxO4rZXUsyezTw4QwWtzn=w450-h338-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
