We ordered drinks straight away and could NOT BELIEVE the great value ! My husband and cousin had a pint of guiness only £2.99! We expect to spend anything between £3.50 and £5 for that anywhere else.
We were served by a couple of barmaids and waitresses and all were lovely and well
mannered and very helpful.
We all ate for £35.96 and we all had the burger and a drink deals what a bargain! I even had a sweet !!!

John Dixon,a year ago,5,"This review relates solely to the vegan breakfast consumed 6 times over the last 4 weeks, various days of the week usually within the first 2 hours of opening.

Some of the time the breakfast has been below expectations. With some items with issues: Toast slightly burned, vegan sausage over cooked, Tomatoes not cooked and Mushrooms undercooked / over oiled and slimy.

Two occasions however the breakfast has been very good with no complaints on any of the items.

Also (I don’t use the spread so never complained) most times it’s served with lurpak rather than the vegan spread which concerns me the staff may not be aware of the correct definition of a vegan diet.

3 stars awarded due to 2/6 breakfast no complaints, environment is always pleasant clean and organised, serving staff good service, and speedy service.

I would come again as value is good, coffee is good and would hope quality become more consistent across the breakfast items.

Edit - since writing the review I’ve had two delicious breakfasts with every element cooked as good as it can be (with the right spread) so upping to 5 stars. If your vegan miss a good cooked breakfast and like rich/dark roast coffee plus good value would recommend.",17,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Christine Adamson,10 months ago,4,"Like most Wetherspoons it can get very busy at certain times and this converted cinema is on a single level  - though there is a raised area up a narrow ramp towards the kitchen area to the back of the building as you enter. As it's one level it does mean there is less seating available. This means that toilets are all on the ground floor though which I think many will appreciate.
Again, like other Wetherspoons you can theoretically order at the table however in practice I have found that this seems to fail in certain areas of the building.
There are 2 coffee machines (to the left as you enter) but these are a somewhat badly positioned as one tends to block the narrow ramp to the kitchen, some seating and also the disabled toilet which is obviously less than ideal.
The building itself retains some of the original features of it's heritage which gives it originality.",44,40,True,3,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjP-LweJbobF7t02XGDQY2VU14pXLPqUJtsFq0=w450-h675-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJvM4d-91ExhbWOvHMeP33kMi55KV986djbD0U=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSe1An5F_5xBuV0YasONVLNcLUXWKkv1lz8bHt=w450-h338-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Janet Woods,3 months ago,4,Very disappointed with the food today. We ordered 2 pizzas & 1 medium steak with jacket potato. Where we were sat we could see the food under the heat lamps waiting to be served to the customers & noticed a steak & jacket potato had been stood there 15 minutes. 2 pizzas then came out to be served. The server picked up the pizzas & the steak that had been under the heat lamps for 15 minutes  & brought it to our table. The steak was all burnt on the top & dried up. This was sent back & a 2nd steak cooked correctly  but with the same jacket potato which again was put under the heat lamps while the steak was being cooked was brought back to the table. Not good enough. The pizzas were hot & tasty.

Using their app which is quick and easy to use has proved on service times and cut down on rhe queues around the bar. Ok so it is now a bit shabby but with the post oandemic situation I would rather have decent food and general cleanliness than new décor. The only part that foes need improving are the ladies toilets. I cannot comment on the gents but I hate having to use the ladies. They are grim, have been since well before lockdown and I cannot recall any update for many years. Filthy cracked sinks, doors that dont shut, locks that dont work, no liq soap in dispensers, broken loo seats, generally grotty. Really let the place down. No doubt much of the damage is done during the evenings when it becomes more of a bar. Why then put in porcelain sinks?

I wouldn’t give this place 1 star if it would let me.
Travelled from Newcastle and Doncaster for a family get together,ordered a ultimate burger meal and cheese and a cheese and tomato panini,a chicken burger and pizza.
We waited 50 minutes for the food,when it eventually arrived it didn’t resemble anything like we ordered.the Panini wasn’t in the traditional bread,but on a soggy round roll,lacking any cheese and a sliver of tomato.the ultimate burger was a beef patty in between soggy bread,no burger sauce as stated and no onion rings.
When we asked where the burger sauce and onion rings were,we were told they had ran out.
Asked to speak to the manager to get her to explain why they thought it was acceptable to send this garbage out…and she stated ‘not to shout at her because she isn’t in charge of the kitchen’
Requested a full refund for the meal,and thanks to Wetherspoons they ruined a rare family day out.

It wasnt my intention too, and she didn't want an alcoholic drink the coke was for her. Incredibly embarrassed i finished my order, and returned to my daughter. I asked to see her ID, on which it sats thus card should not be refused for ID. So still upset i returned to the bar and quietly explained to the staff that this card not have been refused only to be told once again that they dont except it. Customers around were also cross as it was so obvious common sense wasnt being taken into consideration. It wasnt the not excepting the ID i was upset about, it was being shouted at and made to feel like im not a responsible human being who excepts that rules and regulations are in place for a reason.

Damien Walsh,6 months ago,3,"We visited as a group of 4 on Saturday, late afternoon. The pub was very busy as Bury had a football match on and a lot of supports were there.
Despite it being busy we were served quite quickly as they had pleanty of staff on and the staff were polite and friendly.

After a round of drinks we managed to get a table so sat down for further drinks. The drinks selection, quality and price are all very good and typical of most Wetherspoons. They often get this right and one of the reasons I always go back to Wetherspoons across the country. Wetherspoons is exceptionally good value for money.

Two of the group ordered food. One dish was a pizza and I ordered a vegan beyond burger and chips.

The food came within a reasonable time frame. Pizza was reported to be nice but the vegan burger was very disappointing. It was very dark in colour and very dry, it had been over cooked or more likely cooked in a batch and left to sit for a very long period of time in a warmer or warm plate or even reheated.

The building itself is beautiful and has some really nice architecture and decor. It even has a down stairs female toilet (I know, you don't see that often in wetherspoons) and large seating areas however the furniture and carpets have probably seen better days.

Damien Walsh,6 months ago,3,"We visited as a group of 4 on Saturday, late afternoon. The pub was very busy as Bury had a football match on and a lot of supports were there.
Despite it being busy we were served quite quickly as they had pleanty of staff on and the staff were polite and friendly.

After a round of drinks we managed to get a table so sat down for further drinks. The drinks selection, quality and price are all very good and typical of most Wetherspoons. They often get this right and one of the reasons I always go back to Wetherspoons across the country. Wetherspoons is exceptionally good value for money.

Two of the group ordered food. One dish was a pizza and I ordered a vegan beyond burger and chips.

The food came within a reasonable time frame. Pizza was reported to be nice but the vegan burger was very disappointing. It was very dark in colour and very dry, it had been over cooked or more likely cooked in a batch and left to sit for a very long period of time in a warmer or warm plate or even reheated.

The building itself is beautiful and has some really nice architecture and decor. It even has a down stairs female toilet (I know, you don't see that often in wetherspoons) and large seating areas however the furniture and carpets have probably seen better days.

If your out for a drink I would recommend a visit, good pint at a great price.",124,1246,True,4,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-bQ89KIntm-1TlypLRpnZ-6-YMoiQvRLePfIx=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6wXq1f-JsVrdItN3s2UEKp0T1T_Z1F2OZQAAN=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUzlYA_TADFf4lVc9zxMcUoA0sbJNBcieC4tWq=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsYd0-uIMZC-8lU-m-GRmAn6iunbsyGTUAbLUI=w450-h338-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Christine Adamson,10 months ago,4,"Like most Wetherspoons it can get very busy at certain times and this converted cinema is on a single level  - though there is a raised area up a narrow ramp towards the kitchen area to the back of the building as you enter. As it's one level it does mean there is less seating available. This means that toilets are all on the ground floor though which I think many will appreciate.
Again, like other Wetherspoons you can theoretically order at the table however in practice I have found that this seems to fail in certain areas of the building.
There are 2 coffee machines (to the left as you enter) but these are a somewhat badly positioned as one tends to block the narrow ramp to the kitchen, some seating and also the disabled toilet which is obviously less than ideal.
The building itself retains some of the original features of it's heritage which gives it originality.",44,40,True,3,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjP-LweJbobF7t02XGDQY2VU14pXLPqUJtsFq0=w450-h675-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJvM4d-91ExhbWOvHMeP33kMi55KV986djbD0U=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSe1An5F_5xBuV0YasONVLNcLUXWKkv1lz8bHt=w450-h338-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

The server picked up the pizzas & the steak that had been under the heat lamps for 15 minutes  & brought it to our table. The steak was all burnt on the top & dried up. This was sent back & a 2nd steak cooked correctly  but with the same jacket potato which again was put under the heat lamps while the steak was being cooked was brought back to the table. Not good enough. The pizzas were hot & tasty.

John Dixon,a year ago,5,"This review relates solely to the vegan breakfast consumed 6 times over the last 4 weeks, various days of the week usually within the first 2 hours of opening.

Some of the time the breakfast has been below expectations. With some items with issues: Toast slightly burned, vegan sausage over cooked, Tomatoes not cooked and Mushrooms undercooked / over oiled and slimy.

Two occasions however the breakfast has been very good with no complaints on any of the items.

Also (I don’t use the spread so never complained) most times it’s served with lurpak rather than the vegan spread which concerns me the staff may not be aware of the correct definition of a vegan diet.

3 stars awarded due to 2/6 breakfast no complaints, environment is always pleasant clean and organised, serving staff good service, and speedy service.

I would come again as value is good, coffee is good and would hope quality become more consistent across the breakfast items.

Edit - since writing the review I’ve had two delicious breakfasts with every element cooked as good as it can be (with the right spread) so upping to 5 stars.

I wouldn’t give this place 1 star if it would let me.
Travelled from Newcastle and Doncaster for a family get together,ordered a ultimate burger meal and cheese and a cheese and tomato panini,a chicken burger and pizza.
We waited 50 minutes for the food,when it eventually arrived it didn’t resemble anything like we ordered.the Panini wasn’t in the traditional bread,but on a soggy round roll,lacking any cheese and a sliver of tomato.the ultimate burger was a beef patty in between soggy bread,no burger sauce as stated and no onion rings.
When we asked where the burger sauce and onion rings were,we were told they had ran out.
Asked to speak to the manager to get her to explain why they thought it was acceptable to send this garbage out…and she stated ‘not to shout at her because she isn’t in charge of the kitchen’

They are grim, have been since well before lockdown and I cannot recall any update for many years. Filthy cracked sinks, doors that dont shut, locks that dont work, no liq soap in dispensers, broken loo seats, generally grotty. Really let the place down.

Bearing in mind my daughter had already asked to order our food and a dark fruits (cidar) and a coke! The order hadnt changed but before i git my order out, a young male bartenter screamed at me across the bar, 'and dont try and buy alcohol for your daughter' everyone looked around and i was so embarrassed. It wasnt my intention too, and she didn't want an alcoholic drink the coke was for her. Incredibly embarrassed i finished my order, and returned to my daughter. I asked to see her ID, on which it sats thus card should not be refused for ID. So still upset i returned to the bar and quietly explained to the staff that this card not have been refused only to be told once again that they dont except it. Customers around were also cross as it was so obvious common sense wasnt being taken into consideration. It wasnt the not excepting the ID i was upset about, it was being shouted at and made to feel like im not a responsible human being who excepts that rules and regulations are in place for a reason.

The bus was caught in traffic and I phoned to say I was going to be late The person on the phone said I have an interview at 3-15  but according to the email the interview takes 30-40 mins ? so how was that arranged when my interview was 3 ! I said I would wait which I did for 1 hout  and ten minutes then to be told by a member of staff who went to a young lad at the bar hugging him before she came to me and stared that she had overrun could I come back tomorrow at 5.30 .
