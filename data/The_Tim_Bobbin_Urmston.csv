Nina Kwasniewska,8 years ago,3,"So sad that this place has gone downhill so much of late. We have been visiting here regularly for a few years and it used to be really good. Staff would come and ask if everything was ok with your meal, then clear up after you had finished. Those days are long gone sadly.

We went in on Monday evening, 10  Aug 2015. There was only one customer waiting to be served but she was faffing about with her order and, with only one poor lad behind the bar, pulling drinks, taking food orders and making coffees, we waited for the best part of 10 mins just to get drinks. We asked why he was on his own and he said he didn't know where the manager was and his colleague had gone on a cig break.

We later ordered food and waited about half an hour with nothing appearing. It was only when my partner went to the bar and asked what had happened with our food that it appeared. Even then they got my order wrong (asked for a pulled pork wrap, got a pulled pork burger). By this time I was losing the will to live so just accepted what I was given. Luckily the food was quite nice. And I actually got salad dressing with my salad, whereas the last few times I have been told they have run out of dressing.

A lad eventually came to clear away our plates (unusual in itself as you often have to clear plates from a table you want to sit at yourself). He didn't even bother looking at us or asking if our meals had been ok.
