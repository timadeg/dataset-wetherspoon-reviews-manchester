Joanna M L Fearn,a year ago,3,"My friend and I came to visit Manchester for the weekend on Sat 29th Oct 22 as we came for a show at the Manchester A.O Arena. On Sun 30th Oct 22, we wanted breakfast but missed Mc D's so I suggested a Wetherspoons as I know you can still order an all-day breakfast even if its past Breakfast Menu time.

We were staying nearby so didn't have far to walk to The Paramount. Upon arrival and entering on Sun - 30-10-22, it was extremely busy. It is a very big place but was quite packed which we soon discovered was due to a football match being on and screened. However, it didn't take long to find somewhere to sit, and we found a nice comfortable booth style table to sit at.

Ordering on the app is fast and straight-forward. We ordered the All-day brunch with some orange juice and didn't have to wait long to be served. The food was cooked well and very tasty. The chips were ""THE BEST!"" - Piping hot and crispy. My friend and I find Wetherspoons chains to be reliable and affordable.

Only gripe was the table felt a bit sticky and glasses were not cleared. We were bothered by a fly too. I understand the premises is very busy, but it would help if tables were cleaned.

Overall good experience. Good food and price.

Jack Ellison,a month ago,1,"I don’t expect a lot of a Wetherspoons pub, but this falls short even of that.
The first drink I wanted - and that according to the app they had in stock - had run out. So the other drink I wanted, that had run out as well. The third option? Run out too. Had a can of something that wasn’t all that cheap, so could have gone to a semi-decent pub instead.
Clientele? Arguing children.
Toilets? Three cubicles in the men’s in what is a fairly large pub. First cubicle? Out of service. Second cubicle? No toilet paper. Third cubicle? Toilet paper so tight in the receptacle that it could barely be rotated.
Sat at a table with eight empty glasses (not mine sadly), two plates of nasty looking leftover food and ripped-up beer mats etc.

The Venue; large open plan, with a small upstairs area and a fair outside dining area. Looked clean at first glance, however tables were sticky and slightly dirty, not too bad.

I ordered the large breakfast w/ halloumi + scrambled eggs. (I'll be rating everything for worst to best on the plate)

1. Halloumi - burnt to a f**King crisp all I could tast was yesterday's fry up. 3/10

2. Egg - tasted like a fake plastic tea set egg, with centre so dry it needed my tears to rehydrate. 4/10

3. Beans - standard can't complain. 6/10

4. Scrambled eggs - nothing to complain about, just need to add salt/pepper to liking and your good 👍  6/10

5. Bacon - slightly burnt and tasted like it had been cooked in the mouldy halloumi pan, but not too bad, smoky and tasty, probably to some ppls liking. Does the job 6/10

6. Sausage - exactly what your expecting, nice decent size, sausage. Slightly looks like a dogs 🐕 wiener but I ain't complaining 7/10

7. Hash brown - its hard to miss the mark here and they don't. Lovely, fluffy potato 🥔  probably asdas own brand, banging 9/10

Overall = 6/10 which is good for a spoons, yes there is better out there, but you don't come for the best, you come for half decent at low price.

And I did finish everything(aside from 1 slab of halloumi) so can't complain.  👍",47,27,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

When we asked for the manager he accused US of being 'awkward'!!!! If I thought it was possible to reserve a table in Wetherspoons we would reserve one every weekend.

Terry Hughes,4 years ago,4,"So normally this pub has a reasonable range of real ales on tap especially locally brewed from within the North West of England. One point: they could have more lower gravity ales available i.e. lower than 4.4% ABV. Also sold are a variety of craft ales with a broad selection of draught/bottled lagers/ ciders. Hot drinks are dispensed from a Swiss self-service machine and they cost a modest £1.50 then free refills. The coffee (Italian Lavazza) is especially tasty.

I have been coming here since 2004 and the meal prices have risen on an annual basis but the food is still fairly competitively priced. Excellent value for breakfasts till midday. This is a Rugby Union friendly place and they have a large drop-down screen plus multiple TVs to watch e.g. the 6 Nations and any union internationals shown on terrestrial TV. I imagine the 2019 Rugby World Cup will be shown later this year.

Some staff could be more focussed while you are waiting to be served. I inwardly groan when I hear the ubiquitous salutation of ""who's next!"". Then someone pushes in front of you….

There is free Sky WiFi onsite. Staff are generally friendly plus the management couples have always been very polite, approachable and professional when I have visited. Men's toilets are usually clean, complete with  Airforce hand dryers and full soap dispensers. Sadly, a lot of men who use this pub's toilets rarely use the free soap and water after availing themselves of the facilities.",127,116,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

After a couple minutes, the manager came back and grabbed my open makeup bag, causing some to drop on the floor, and began to take it outside to leave on the floor. When I was coming back to the table to retrieve my other belongings, he grabs them as well as trying to grab my sister and continues outside with them.

Edwin Cooke,4 years ago,2,"I ordered a pint of Phoenix IPA as part of a round of drinks. My mate had been drinking Pheonix IPA all night.  This idiot Irish bar tender who looked about 15 years old started pouring a pint of Wobbly Bob. I stopped him and said, ""no, I want Pheonix IPA"", so he continued pouring it telling me I was wrong and the only Pheonix brewery beer they sold was Wobbly Bob. I told him I didn't want Wobbly Bob, so he asked another bar person, who duly pointed to the correct pump for Pheonix IPA (which was at the other end of the bar). So he came back and asked me to pay for the drinks he had poured. I said that I didn't want Wobbly Bob  I wanted Pheonix IPA. Amazingly, he repeated that Wobbly Bob was the only Pheonix beer they sold.  So I pointed out to this idiot, that I had just watched him ask his colleague and it was in that pump over there. He then demanded I pay for the drinks he had poured (including the Wobbly Bob). I said no, pour me a Pheonix IPA first.  With much reluctance he eventually poured me a Pheonix IPA and I paid him for the drinks I ordered. Why did I have to argue with this idiot?

I have been drinking in pubs for almost 35 years and have never experienced such a blatant attempt to give you something you did not order in a pub in my life. The fact he repeatedly tried to trick me into paying for a drink I had not ordered is bad, however when you consider Wobbly Bob is a very strong beer, this is utterly irresponsible. The guy who served me should be sacked.

Clientele? Arguing children.
Toilets? Three cubicles in the men’s in what is a fairly large pub. First cubicle? Out of service. Second cubicle? No toilet paper. Third cubicle? Toilet paper so tight in the receptacle that it could barely be rotated.

The customer did not apologize at first, and said a lot of insulting words like“fucking your language”“fucking ur country”and laughed with his friend. We went to the security staff for help, but the security staff thought that we would not accept the man's apology and even said that if we did this, we would be banned from drinking outside (I still remember the security staff), which was clearly a biased directive.

Joanna M L Fearn,a year ago,3,"My friend and I came to visit Manchester for the weekend on Sat 29th Oct 22 as we came for a show at the Manchester A.O Arena. On Sun 30th Oct 22, we wanted breakfast but missed Mc D's so I suggested a Wetherspoons as I know you can still order an all-day breakfast even if its past Breakfast Menu time.

We were staying nearby so didn't have far to walk to The Paramount. Upon arrival and entering on Sun - 30-10-22, it was extremely busy. It is a very big place but was quite packed which we soon discovered was due to a football match being on and screened. However, it didn't take long to find somewhere to sit, and we found a nice comfortable booth style table to sit at.

Ordering on the app is fast and straight-forward. We ordered the All-day brunch with some orange juice and didn't have to wait long to be served. The food was cooked well and very tasty. The chips were ""THE BEST!"" - Piping hot and crispy. My friend and I find Wetherspoons chains to be reliable and affordable.

Only gripe was the table felt a bit sticky and glasses were not cleared. We were bothered by a fly too. I understand the premises is very busy, but it would help if tables were cleaned.

Overall good experience. Good food and price. Can't complain!",129,492,True,4,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0dDtvVWGtHRZ97FBYkjK2uY4deXox4LOItGOd=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4Xn_b7BkRW3SqotxrvU31bkaGTayR__CFbWRo=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrgY_W1fjzWV0TBFUSWhV18WYuOoi6pPf7R5yV=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQTRuTEthrLXa2Dpbxh7Bs6GCwJgEZSjkBeV54=w450-h338-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Hogmanes Art,a year ago,3,"(For reference I was here from around opening time)

The Venue; large open plan, with a small upstairs area and a fair outside dining area. Looked clean at first glance, however tables were sticky and slightly dirty, not too bad.

I ordered the large breakfast w/ halloumi + scrambled eggs. (I'll be rating everything for worst to best on the plate)

1. Halloumi - burnt to a f**King crisp all I could tast was yesterday's fry up. 3/10

2. Egg - tasted like a fake plastic tea set egg, with centre so dry it needed my tears to rehydrate. 4/10

3. Beans - standard can't complain. 6/10

4. Scrambled eggs - nothing to complain about, just need to add salt/pepper to liking and your good 👍  6/10

5. Bacon - slightly burnt and tasted like it had been cooked in the mouldy halloumi pan, but not too bad, smoky and tasty, probably to some ppls liking. Does the job 6/10

6. Sausage - exactly what your expecting, nice decent size, sausage. Slightly looks like a dogs 🐕 wiener but I ain't complaining 7/10

7. Hash brown - its hard to miss the mark here and they don't. Lovely, fluffy potato 🥔  probably asdas own brand, banging 9/10

Overall = 6/10 which is good for a spoons, yes there is better out there, but you don't come for the best, you come for half decent at low price.

And I did finish everything(aside from 1 slab of halloumi) so can't complain.  👍",47,27,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Then the very rude manager ran to the table to rudely say ''YOU HAVE TO MOVE I'VE PROMISED THIS TABLE TO THESE''. After calling him out for how rude he was been his apology wasnt very sincere so safe to say wont be returning and hope they get a better manager!

Steve,2 years ago,5,"Sunday 12th Sept 2021.
Sat at the table and ordered two drinks through the app .
Pub wasn't over busy and small queue at bar with customers.5,10 and at 15 minutes no drinks.I told the server at a nearby table  that Ive been waiting too long for drinks and his reply was ""upto 35 mins "" WHAT? I could have gone to the bar twice.10 minutes later I asked to see a manager and a few minutes later a regular server came over.I told her how bad the service was and I wanted my money back and had to leave.She then went to the bar,looked up at the monitor and said something to the servers- walked down to the end of the bar and replaced my two drinks (bottles) into chiller and went to the till.
We sat there another 5 minutes as the manager carried on doing lounge service.In the end and on leaving I asked her had my refund gone back on my  card.She replied ""yes"" to which I replied "" couldn't you have come over and told me as you could see me trying to get your attention ""  she said ""sorry' then I was told 24 to 48 hours for refund on card.
I've been coming to The Paramount for years weekly.
I wish the landlords were around to have reported it to them in the first instance .

Shu-lin Liu,2 years ago,1,"Not expecting 5 star Michelin food from weatherspoons...but at least remove the PLASTIC from my FROZEN lasagna when you take it out of the microwave, come on! Gordon Ramsay would be so disappointed.

I got my lasagne but the middle of it was stone cold and not even heated up properly had to wasted my time chasing down a waitress to heat it up properly. In the end, it was still  rubbery and dry, definitely not creamy at all! How can you make a lasgne taste so crumpsty?? Not only did I had to fish out a huge piece of plastic that was left on my plate. It completely ruined the time that I had there and I definitely WONT be back for the food!",4,11,False,2,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCj9XRQpQfDznbI9uj-fLzRXbSv4PmZ5LdTCY=w450-h675-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtVdrmtkuV4J7fQjgu1n6edeIUyEVFxn2W0zQ=w450-h675-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

MILLICENT,2 years ago,1,"We visited as a group after finishing an all-night hospitality shift for a breakfast and an after-work alcoholic beverage.
My friend asked what time alcohol was being served and the bold Greek bartender with a beard and stretched ears assumed we had all been drinking, even after explaining we had been working. I politely asked the bar tender for an apology to my friend, which he didn't. I spoke to the manager on shift and she refused to give me the name of the bar tender for this review. NOT INDUSTRY FRIENDLY, IMPOLITE AND RUDE.

paul hassall,3 years ago,1,"Definitely the worst Wetherspoons we have ever been in ..... especially during these Covid 19 times .
Seemed great at first ... greeted and asked to fill out contact tracing at entrance  .... then told to go and find a table 👍🏻
All unoccupied tables were filthy, covered in dirty plates ,cutlery, napkins and leftover food . Eventually sat down upstairs on a little table which only had dirty cutlery left on it , moved it to another full dirty table.
The place felt dirty and dank 😟
Food ordered , came quickly which was great however it was so bland apart from the “old oil” taste ... and we all had semi cooked chips 😟
We left most of our meals and vacated the place ASAP 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",2,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
Tracy Dryburgh,2 years ago,1,"Shocking service and bad attitude from bar staff. Put order in waited 25 minutes, one of the staff noticed we had waited a long time, he went to a member of bar staff to ask about are drinks and he was told that we had to wait, then we noticed another member of bar staff go to a bin and pulled a handful of receipts out of the bin and are's  was one that had bin put in the bin.

When we asked for the manager he accused US of being 'awkward'!!!! If I thought it was possible to reserve a table in Wetherspoons we would reserve one every weekend.

The young couple were sat at a window seat with the large sign saying no smoking looking at them and also the staff delivered drinks to there table on more than one occasion and never said anything to them.

Edwin Cooke,4 years ago,2,"I ordered a pint of Phoenix IPA as part of a round of drinks. My mate had been drinking Pheonix IPA all night.  This idiot Irish bar tender who looked about 15 years old started pouring a pint of Wobbly Bob. I stopped him and said, ""no, I want Pheonix IPA"", so he continued pouring it telling me I was wrong and the only Pheonix brewery beer they sold was Wobbly Bob. I told him I didn't want Wobbly Bob, so he asked another bar person, who duly pointed to the correct pump for Pheonix IPA (which was at the other end of the bar). So he came back and asked me to pay for the drinks he had poured. I said that I didn't want Wobbly Bob  I wanted Pheonix IPA. Amazingly, he repeated that Wobbly Bob was the only Pheonix beer they sold.  So I pointed out to this idiot, that I had just watched him ask his colleague and it was in that pump over there. He then demanded I pay for the drinks he had poured (including the Wobbly Bob). I said no, pour me a Pheonix IPA first.  With much reluctance he eventually poured me a Pheonix IPA and I paid him for the drinks I ordered. Why did I have to argue with this idiot?

I have been drinking in pubs for almost 35 years and have never experienced such a blatant attempt to give you something you did not order in a pub in my life. The fact he repeatedly tried to trick me into paying for a drink I had not ordered is bad, however when you consider Wobbly Bob is a very strong beer, this is utterly irresponsible. The guy who served me should be sacked.
