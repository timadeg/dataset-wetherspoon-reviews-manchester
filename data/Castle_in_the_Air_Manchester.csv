Shaun,4 years ago,5,"The best weatherspoons period.

This place just doesnt look like the usual dull well used Weatherspoons that are normally scattered around.

The food served is also much better. They care about what they're cooking here and provide a nice presented plate of food unlike others.

Prices are the typical weatherspoons that are very reasonable with plenty of drinks on offer and plenty of food to choose from. You can also go different nights for cheaper meal deals like Fish Friday etc.

If you're visiting Manchester and staying in the  nearby hotels then this is great for food especially if you visit the beyond ski slope.",206,2798,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

S√∏ren Mortensen,4 years ago,5,"Was here to have breakfast. I ordered the large English breakfast. There were three of us who each ordered our menu. There were three sizes of breakfast. I think it tasted exactly as it should, we got it served at the table quite quickly and the price was very reasonable. If you order coffee, there is a free refill. If you want to go out and have a traditional English breakfast, I can definitely recommend the place. Then you can end up skiing next door where they have a huge indoor ski hill.",186,85,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Karen Barnes,5 months ago,1,Absolutely annoyed I am! Came with my family for food. Went to the bar there was a lad serving a family and taking a while. I was stood away waiting. Then the girl that was serving to the left of me doing orders continued to chat to a kitchen person and finished orders. At least 4 times she ignored me and even smiled at me. Next to men came to the bar and she talked to them and served them. That was so rude!!! Then the lad told her I was waiting and to serve me. How rude can a person be! Nice enough when bothering to serve me but absolutely no manners at all. She knew she was ignoring me!

Now all the menus were still on the tables and no signage to state that they were not serving food ,staff members seen us walk in and didn't think to mention to incoming customers they weren't serving food.

Also the  table was grubby and dirty ,also a piece of trodden on food was on the carpet ,now I'd understand this if they were run of there feet but seemed some of the staff were just having a chat .

I understand this is a weatherspoons and not the most glamorous place but today was ridiculous .

James Rice,2 years ago,1,"The service was poor waited and waited for them to come to the table so we could order. As I wanted to request to swap an item on the menu which can not be done on the app. After 15 mins I went to the bar to try and order and was told by the male manager in the checked shirt that you can only use the app at our table. I then said I wanted to swap the ham on the egg Benedict for hash browns and was frowned up on and said they can not do that. I said that's what we always get at the Eccles branch. He then said every kitchen is different. A young lady then said she will ask the chef if it possible to do so. She came back and said yes this time only they can!
Should of just gone Some where else very off putting.

The poached eggs were pretty much hard boiled. I think it's fair to say we definitely won't be going there again. Manager abnoxious & and did not care about the customer at all.

When I asked if I could please just have 2 edible ones and explained  I'd be happy the girl said that was how they have been coming (meaning in pieces I think) but she could maybe ask. Partnered with the bar staff member calling over to a colleague to finish my order (half way through ordering 2 meals so nothing major??) So he could go and answer the phone - which was ringing 3 feet from the bar supervisor who was wiping a counter - without even so much as a courtesy ""do you mind"" kind of spoilt the whole experience.

Gaizka N,3 months ago,3,"This particular branch of Wetherspoon doesn't offer anything exceptional, apart from its large terrace located next to a relatively quiet road. The food served here is consistent with the low-quality standard you would expect from any other Wetherspoon location, while the drinks remain affordable as usual.

One notable difference is the clientele that frequents this branch. Unlike some other Wetherspoon establishments, the crowd here seems to be a bit different. You won't encounter the usual ""dodgy"" individuals that you might come across in some Wetherspoon pubs.

The refillable tea and coffee was ace, thank you. As was the pint of orange.   Service pretty average but we didn't really give them opportunity to show us different to be fair.  Pub felt clean.
