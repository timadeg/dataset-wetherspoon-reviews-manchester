Jacqueline Cubici,4 years ago,5,"This is a big pub with lots of beer and drinks to choose from.  Beer and drinks are very cheap, and I don't know how we did not get drunk, but some in my group were at least tipsy, and they had a nap on the way back.. :) - Food is also very good value for money.  The only thing I didn't like is that my husband and son asked for two burgers and chips without asking me if I wanted anything to eat. :) The burger looked like  it was made with real meat and the chips were fresh chips and not reheated like you get in some pubs - I ended up picking chips and a bite of my husband's burger - he offer me a whole one, but I kept thinking about the amount of calories that the burger had and my dress would not had fit it me for the party that night.  The pub has big ""french"" doors, and in hot days, such as the one we went - they open then, so it was more like an open pub (obviously), you know what I mean.  The pub is in front of this beautiful and big church of Bury, I think  is the Bury parish church, just in case you drink to much and fancy proposing an marring your girlfriend/boyfriend, you don't have to go to far before you regret it.  we didn't visit the church as we had not enough time, and drinking beer after visiting the market was more important than visiting the church - we will have time for that in the next visit.   I wonder if in this Bury church, the marry and Bury too... I defiantly recommend it! :)",51,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Tony Wilson,3 months ago,4,"Nice pub in the centre of Bury.
The food was good and well presented although didnt seem to have as much choice on the menu as some other Witherspoon's.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The toilets were down stairs although there was a disabled toilet on the ground floor.
Only grumble was the drinks were served in plastic glasses which we were told was because there was a football match at  Bury Football Club but that is a mile away from the pub, very strange.",129,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,3,5,3,Not found

Daniel,3 years ago,1,"Utterly bizarre experience here on Tuesday. Having a gluten allergy the majority of the menu is unsuitable for me, I placed my order via the app and then bar staff came to inform me that I needed to order more food, I asked to see the manager, who then despite me telling them I have an allergy advised that I'd have to order chips or else he could not serve anybody at the table. I was dining with two others who had satisfied their substantial meal criteria. We tried to compromise by ordering onion rings which would get eaten by others at the table however the manager refused to budge. So we payed for the extra chips and left them, utterly bizarre. Having a gluten allergy and knowing enough about Tim Martin's practices I try to avoid Spoons and this has given me no further reason to visit. Its well published that Spoons uses the popular catering supplier Brakes which is mass microwaved ready meals, support independent instead, which I realise opportunities in the center are incredibly short.",1,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
Andrew Fachau,5 years ago,1,"Firstly, it's a Wetherspoons so for some that will be review enough - a warning or an invitation depending on your tastes. I've been before and it has been poor for different reasons. The service was slow and beyond indifferent - they had drinks in their fridges not on the system (out of stock apparently) and confusion reined thereafter. The glass I was given had been cleaned in the same way leaving something out in the rain might clean it. As is often the case the place was untidy and littered with wet tables, pots, plates and glasses. We noted that there were more gambling machines than staff. And now the bottomless coffee on offer is self service - like a petrol station but without the friendly staff - and the assumption is that everything will be where it should be if you use it. I had to climb over and past a group of small children who had decided the clear space in front of the coffee machine would be their play area. Boiling water and toddlers a safe combination.

When the food arrived  the beans were  cold, hash browns were luke warm, bacon was cold, mushroom was small and overcooked, sausage burnt at the ends, eggs were  not too bad, nobody came to check if it was o.k & no staff was around to complain to. We were pushed for time and had to leave.

I said ok i will ask someone else to serve me so she then went to the other staff and very loudly stated i was a rude person who should not be served. Scores of customers were listening.
