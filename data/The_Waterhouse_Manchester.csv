Nick Yates,a month ago,3,"Service was pretty quick here, and the food was good - exactly as expected from any Wetherspoons.
The big downside to this location was the atmosphere. Around 5pm on a Monday, and it was unbelievably noisy with a few tables of people drinking and shouting. This isn't really the fault of Wetherspoons, although some things could be done to mitigate it. The tables are spread throughout several smaller rooms, and packed in very tightly. There isn't much to dampen the sound, so a couple of noisy tables in one room was enough to make it so we couldn't hear well enough to hold a conversation across our table.
Fewer tables per room, and maybe some curtains or something to absorb some sound, would make it slightly more bearable. But based on this experience, I wouldn't return to this branch.",123,2025,True,0,,¬£1‚Äì10,4,4,1,Not found

Service usually quick and friendly.

This pub stands in the shadow of Manchester Town Hall. The rapid expansion of the city and the ambitions of its civic leaders led to the creation of a municipal palace of unrivalled splendour. Completed in 1877, this civic palace was designed by Alfred Waterhouse, also responsible for several other buildings in the city. Its internal mosaic design incorporates a pattern of bees, symbolic of Manchester‚Äôs industry, which is also found on the city‚Äôs coat of arms.

The text reads: This Wetherspoon pub takes its name from the leading 19th century architect Alfred Waterhouse, who designed the grandiose Town Hall building opposite here.

Waterhouse had already designed Manchester Assizes and Strangeways Gaol before winning the design contest for a new town hall, in 1868. The triangular building, with nearly 1,000 rooms, is recognised as his masterpiece. It was eight years in the making and was described as ‚Äúa municipal place‚Äù by the city‚Äôs Radical MP John Bright, whose statue is one of the many sculptures it now contains.

Design motifs on the mosaic floors include cotton flowers, the basis of the city‚Äôs prosperity, and bees. The bees, which also appear on the city‚Äôs coat of arms, symbolise Manchester‚Äôs industrious workers. The 280 feet high clock tower houses 23 bells. The eight-ton hour bell is nicknamed ‚ÄòBig Abel‚Äô after Alderman Abel Hayward, who opened the building. It is inscribed with the line: ‚ÄúRing out the false, ring in the true‚Äù, from Tennyson‚Äôs poem In Memoriam.

Waterhouse also designed London‚Äôs Natural History Museum, as well as Manchester‚Äôs Owens College. His use of terracotta and brick in educational buildings is said to be the origin of the term ‚Äòred-brick‚Äô, a term for universities which were originally municipal colleges.

The text reads: Stepping Back into History
Architectural history beneath your feet.
The staircase exposed during the renovation of this building dates from the Georgian period.
It takes us back over two hundred years, providing a vivid link with the past, and indicating the original cellular layout of the Georgian structure.

It is believed that this pub used to be an orphanage and it‚Äôs confirmed that it was a solicitor‚Äôs. These premises were made up of three town houses. There are features in the pub today which show clearly its original layout and design.",883,3941,True,4,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG7Gz4mOkcY5FWxsE2en6ktoxh4LL_qY0SES8E=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMddwR9z3jksC5xcs-KVhrNEGFzX09EJz4KWg8L=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMD6aswYue3lTVE5ELwXic3QW-Cgx5ednO5Y1_=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMebRaMZTl2ZJCGWq87kT_3e1OBLUtWs5GFI0SM=w450-h338-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

I took the hint and left. To be honest it was more comical than anything to be effectively refused service in a bloody Wetherspoons. I hadn't had a drink, my clothes were clean and presentable and nobody else batted an eyelid at me. I guess there's a first time for everything.

Now almost normal, partitions removed. Beer festival currently,  so wide selection of diverse real ales. Beer prices steady, but food prices up ENTIRELY due to ending of VAT reductions. Service very good, with seemingly more staff on.

Still probably best pub in Manchester centre.

It's also practically impossible to get a table during busy periods, but that's just testament to what excellent value it represents. There are several other Wetherspoons in Manchester city centre if this one is packed, all within walking distance.

The big downside to this location was the atmosphere. Around 5pm on a Monday, and it was unbelievably noisy with a few tables of people drinking and shouting. This isn't really the fault of Wetherspoons, although some things could be done to mitigate it. The tables are spread throughout several smaller rooms, and packed in very tightly. There isn't much to dampen the sound, so a couple of noisy tables in one room was enough to make it so we couldn't hear well enough to hold a conversation across our table.
Fewer tables per room, and maybe some curtains or something to absorb some sound, would make it slightly more bearable. But based on this experience, I wouldn't return to this branch.",123,2025,True,0,,¬£1‚Äì10,4,4,1,Not found

First of all the guy behind the bar said it was off, before tapping the pump clip with mock surprise when I gestured towards it. Then he announced he'd have to change the barrel. Which wouldn't have been a problem had two people not ordered the same drink and were being served whilst I waited.

I took the hint and left. To be honest it was more comical than anything to be effectively refused service in a bloody Wetherspoons. I hadn't had a drink, my clothes were clean and presentable and nobody else batted an eyelid at me. I guess there's a first time for everything. If it hadn't been the first pub I walked past, I never would have considered it, but I know not to bother at all now.

The reason for the positive review was the place was clean, tidy, busy with staff constantly on the ball, clearing.

The highlight was seeing the young manager wiping the bar down from the customer's side. It seems a minor detail, but too many bars at wetherspoons have wet and sticky bars from being busy it looks sloppy. Not here!

R. Mark Clayton,9 months ago,4,"Regulations means things are not quite back to normal,  but most beers on, although alas not the house ""Wobbly Bob"". Ale quality excellent.  Covid precautions still good. One of the best houses in Manchester still.

Update
Now almost normal, partitions removed. Beer festival currently,  so wide selection of diverse real ales. Beer prices steady, but food prices up ENTIRELY due to ending of VAT reductions. Service very good, with seemingly more staff on.

Still probably best pub in Manchester centre.

Further update,

And so it remains.  Wobbly Bob (best beer in England and house ale!) back on.

And another
Still excellent.  Chips back to their superlative best. Real ale very good, value superb.

Very good Burns Night supper. Great and changing real ale selection.  Swift,  helpful and friendly service. Immaculate disabled toilet. Usual JDW  keen prices.  Hard to think of a fault...",122,2,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Myself and my husband ordered pizzas, with a side order of one garlic bread and one cheese and garlic bread.
Because these are supposed to be cooked to order and not microwaved, like most of restaurant food these days, you would expect them to be piping hot, straight from the pizza oven, that is if Wetherspoon‚Äôs uses pizza ovens. L.O.L.
Guest what ‚Äì they were luke warm, which quite frankly is actually an understatement.
I have some advice for Wetherspoon‚Äôs owner, Tim Martin.

Large, really well set out pub in the heart of Manchester City Centre. Bar should be bigger. Toilets very clean. Great little side rooms to get lost in. Don't pick one beer, pick several! Service usually quick and friendly.

This pub stands in the shadow of Manchester Town Hall. The rapid expansion of the city and the ambitions of its civic leaders led to the creation of a municipal palace of unrivalled splendour. Completed in 1877, this civic palace was designed by Alfred Waterhouse, also responsible for several other buildings in the city. Its internal mosaic design incorporates a pattern of bees, symbolic of Manchester‚Äôs industry, which is also found on the city‚Äôs coat of arms.

The text reads: This Wetherspoon pub takes its name from the leading 19th century architect Alfred Waterhouse, who designed the grandiose Town Hall building opposite here.

Waterhouse had already designed Manchester Assizes and Strangeways Gaol before winning the design contest for a new town hall, in 1868. The triangular building, with nearly 1,000 rooms, is recognised as his masterpiece. It was eight years in the making and was described as ‚Äúa municipal place‚Äù by the city‚Äôs Radical MP John Bright, whose statue is one of the many sculptures it now contains.

Design motifs on the mosaic floors include cotton flowers, the basis of the city‚Äôs prosperity, and bees. The bees, which also appear on the city‚Äôs coat of arms, symbolise Manchester‚Äôs industrious workers. The 280 feet high clock tower houses 23 bells. The eight-ton hour bell is nicknamed ‚ÄòBig Abel‚Äô after Alderman Abel Hayward, who opened the building. It is inscribed with the line: ‚ÄúRing out the false, ring in the true‚Äù, from Tennyson‚Äôs poem In Memoriam.

Waterhouse also designed London‚Äôs Natural History Museum, as well as Manchester‚Äôs Owens College. His use of terracotta and brick in educational buildings is said to be the origin of the term ‚Äòred-brick‚Äô, a term for universities which were originally municipal colleges.

Front Room:
The text reads: Stepping Back into History
Architectural history beneath your feet.
The staircase exposed during the renovation of this building dates from the Georgian period.
It takes us back over two hundred years, providing a vivid link with the past, and indicating the original cellular layout of the Georgian structure.

It is believed that this pub used to be an orphanage and it‚Äôs confirmed that it was a solicitor‚Äôs. These premises were made up of three town houses. There are features in the pub today which show clearly its original layout and design.",883,3941,True,4,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG7Gz4mOkcY5FWxsE2en6ktoxh4LL_qY0SES8E=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMddwR9z3jksC5xcs-KVhrNEGFzX09EJz4KWg8L=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMD6aswYue3lTVE5ELwXic3QW-Cgx5ednO5Y1_=w450-h338-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMebRaMZTl2ZJCGWq87kT_3e1OBLUtWs5GFI0SM=w450-h338-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Ian,a year ago,1,"Shoddy service, staff with attitude, basic menu items out of stock, tatty & sticky furniture, dirty floors and tacky carpets.

A few weeks ago we came into take advantage of the weekend brunch offer.  The bar staff were unable to tell us what the prices were without the drinks.

We finally ordered two different eggs benedict dishes and sat down at our table.  After 10 minutes were were informed the kitchen had run out of eggs - a basic ingredient - even though there is a Tesco Express next door that could be used for emergencies.

We were told we could order any other breakfast - even though there were no eggs.  Unbelievable.  The supervisor serving us had a major attitude problem and spoke to us as if it was our fault there was an issue with having no eggs in the kitchen.  We asked for a refund and to add insult to injury we were given our money back in little piles of the smallest change the supervisor could find!!

The staff at The Waterhouse are certainly doing their best to give Wetherspoons in Manchester a bad name and this experience put us off going to any others in The Group during our week long stay in the city.",224,53,True,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq061_YemHtUt66LsPowQB9C7MEppKc3cQKYFj=w900-h675-p-k-no,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Edit: we came back and the food was a lot better this time however the pizza was a little undercooked. However we noticed an elderly woman wondering around the pub, so we asked her if we could help, it seemed she had dementia and had lost her table with her other bags, after finding this for her I told the bar staff incase it were to happen again.

There‚Äôs not a great seating area outside and inside, it‚Äôs more like drinking within a tight spaced house rather than a pub. If you like that vibe where you feel more like your having a drink and something to eat in a house rather than a pub, than this might be a good place for you. Or if you need somewhere that can be somewhat quiet/ empty in town, then this pub could work.",6,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

The drinks choices are very good! Shame that the Erdinger & Tucher bottled drinks had to stop as they were favourites of ours but we read about why they had to stop & understood. Otherwise no problems with anything else with staff, who are very pleasant & do work extremely hard, maybe having only one person clearing tables & maybe due to cut backs doesn't help the matter?!

Keith Smith,4 years ago,4,"A good breakfast. Stayed at a local hotel and didn't fancy the extortionate cost to upgrade to breakfast included as we knew there were numerous eateries locally. We left our hotel up the road and happened upon this place. It is what it is, a pub with decent grub. We couldn't use the app to order and had been informed when ordering at the bar there's a 30 minute wait for food which we understood as the place was packed even at 11am. When the food arrived it tasted great and was very good value. A perfect place to start our day visiting the markets. The customers were in good spirits and the place was very nice, the layout is a little splintered with rooms here there and everywhere.",101,103,True,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9dtUl7kGK-v2G5ySYdXvdNR3HrJdSiL265zEK=w900-h675-p-k-no,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

Callie Denver,4 years ago,4,"Love the look and layout of this place. Its decor and many rooms give it an overall feel that's more like a house than a pub. Smart, but cosy at the same time, and it has HUGE very posh loos. :) Service is fast and friendly even at busy times (which appear to be all the time). Great value for food and drink and good selection of beers and wines. Clientele a very broad mix, with plenty of professionals popping in at lunch time and after work, mixed in with shoppers and regulars. Very good location for everything, being close to most city centre landmarks, attractions and public transport (the St. Peter's Square Metrolink stop is right outside).",52,5,True,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
David,5 years ago,4,"My favourite pub in Manchester. A Georgian terraced property close to the side of Manchester Town Hall. In a previous life I believe it was used as offices for Solicitors. Has multiple rooms of various sizes, so needs a walk around to locate the perfect sized table for your party!  Been there dozens of times. Great beer & food. The place is desperate for a makeover. Really beginning to look tatty lately. Needs a bit of investment. Needs a makeover and some fresh menus which are not grubby and food stained. Aside from that its a civilised venue with good prices.

I love dogs but why people would think a pub is the place of choice for a dog is beyond me and their barking and whining did irk me some, but not as much as their owners' irritation at the dog for embarrassing them with their noisy protest.
