Lee W,5 months ago,1,Popped by yesterday on Saturday evening. Nobody eating inside - which should‚Äôve been a warning sign. Five years ago the place would e been packed. The pub was dirty with old rotting food scraps on the carpet and under furniture. Rats must have a banquet at night! Toilets were disgusting. I know it‚Äôs Weatherspoons but standards have really dropped. I was tempted to leave but my kids were hungry and I wanted a beer - ordered two adult meals & two kids meals. I know Weatherspoons is cheap and cheerful but what was presented to me made me feel ripped off! I ordered 6oz cheese burger with chips. ¬£14.50 with a beer. Burger was tiny and tasteless with a scattering of burnt chips. See pic - that‚Äôs what I paid for!! Fish and chips too - but it was mostly batter. Plus the bananas didn‚Äôt come out with the kids meals. Staff were miserable.

Lee Watkinson,3 months ago,1,"What can I say ?
I took my wife n 2 children (both under 5) to this establishment after 3 hours of Lego land. We were all very hungry so we decided on a pub lunch. The place was extremely busy but was still ok to find a suitable table for us all. Before we had chance to sit I had to ask one of the staff to clean the table from the previous family. x2 glasses remained on the table, as did the peas and mash from I can only assume a small child as it was also covering the floor where the high chair had been left. Upon asking the staff meme we could he clean the table before we sat down, his response was ‚Äúwhy what‚Äôs up with it?‚Äù. I had to them literally show him what was wrong. After he cleaned the table he walked away. No mention of the messy floor either that was left while we ate.
We order through the ‚Äúapp‚Äù as we thought this would be easier than trailing to the bar. After ordering our food and paying for it online. The drinks were at our table almost straight away. My wife had a coke and asked for no ice to be present. It came with ice. I asked for a non alcoholic Kopperberg. This came warm with a glass full of ice. (Do they not get stored in the fridge?). Almost immediately after our drinks had arrived did so our food. (This was abit alarming). The fact our drinks had arrived to our table 5 mins after sitting down then our food 2 mins after the drinks. This suggests to me that food is already being prepared and then warmed up. I had gone for the chicken jalfrezi and my wife had gone for chicken strips.
My 2 sons had chicken nuggets and spag Bol. The spag Bol was a tiny portion, possibly 5 spoonfuls and you would be finished. The peas with my sons chicken nuggets were cold almost just taken out the freezer.
My curry did look like and taste like a good microwave meal. And the chicken strips looked just awful McDonald‚Äôs copycats. When I asked another staff member for salt they brought it round in paper sachets. Come on seriously? And the cutlery that was brought to our table i wouldn‚Äôt have let my dog lick the fork let alone me use it to eat.Usually we go for steak but upon realising that this particular restaurant doesn‚Äôt do any steak meal?? Wow. Wetherspoon has gone downhill in a big way. Nobody came to ask if we was happy with our food. This was not a nice experience.
I do not recommend the Mardi Gras to anybody.
I think next time if the choice is this place and McDonald‚Äôs then the latter will be the one we go for.

I understand that spoons isn‚Äôt a 5 star dining experience, but in every other place the food is at least edible. I wanted the half chicken- sold out. Steak - sold out. Nachos - sold out. Settled on the ham, chips and eggs. Chips were undercooked and went cold almost instantly. Eggs were over cooked and dry. Ham tasted like it was fresh from a Tesco package and was awful.

Lee Watkinson,3 months ago,1,"What can I say ?
I took my wife n 2 children (both under 5) to this establishment after 3 hours of Lego land. We were all very hungry so we decided on a pub lunch. The place was extremely busy but was still ok to find a suitable table for us all. Before we had chance to sit I had to ask one of the staff to clean the table from the previous family. x2 glasses remained on the table, as did the peas and mash from I can only assume a small child as it was also covering the floor where the high chair had been left. Upon asking the staff meme we could he clean the table before we sat down, his response was ‚Äúwhy what‚Äôs up with it?‚Äù. I had to them literally show him what was wrong. After he cleaned the table he walked away. No mention of the messy floor either that was left while we ate.
We order through the ‚Äúapp‚Äù as we thought this would be easier than trailing to the bar. After ordering our food and paying for it online. The drinks were at our table almost straight away. My wife had a coke and asked for no ice to be present. It came with ice. I asked for a non alcoholic Kopperberg. This came warm with a glass full of ice. (Do they not get stored in the fridge?). Almost immediately after our drinks had arrived did so our food. (This was abit alarming). The fact our drinks had arrived to our table 5 mins after sitting down then our food 2 mins after the drinks. This suggests to me that food is already being prepared and then warmed up. I had gone for the chicken jalfrezi and my wife had gone for chicken strips.
My 2 sons had chicken nuggets and spag Bol. The spag Bol was a tiny portion, possibly 5 spoonfuls and you would be finished. The peas with my sons chicken nuggets were cold almost just taken out the freezer.
My curry did look like and taste like a good microwave meal. And the chicken strips looked just awful McDonald‚Äôs copycats. When I asked another staff member for salt they brought it round in paper sachets. Come on seriously? And the cutlery that was brought to our table i wouldn‚Äôt have let my dog lick the fork let alone me use it to eat.Usually we go for steak but upon realising that this particular restaurant doesn‚Äôt do any steak meal?? Wow. Wetherspoon has gone downhill in a big way. Nobody came to ask if we was happy with our food. This was not a nice experience.
I do not recommend the Mardi Gras to anybody.
I think next time if the choice is this place and McDonald‚Äôs then the latter will be the one we go for.
Stick to greene king or hungry horse for a pub lunch. Stay away from Wetherspoon.",8,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,1,1,1,Not found

Lee W,5 months ago,1,Popped by yesterday on Saturday evening. Nobody eating inside - which should‚Äôve been a warning sign. Five years ago the place would e been packed. The pub was dirty with old rotting food scraps on the carpet and under furniture. Rats must have a banquet at night! Toilets were disgusting. I know it‚Äôs Weatherspoons but standards have really dropped. I was tempted to leave but my kids were hungry and I wanted a beer - ordered two adult meals & two kids meals. I know Weatherspoons is cheap and cheerful but what was presented to me made me feel ripped off! I ordered 6oz cheese burger with chips. ¬£14.50 with a beer. Burger was tiny and tasteless with a scattering of burnt chips. See pic - that‚Äôs what I paid for!! Fish and chips too - but it was mostly batter. Plus the bananas didn‚Äôt come out with the kids meals. Staff were miserable. I used to be a regular at Weatherspoons but no way will I be going back.,17,14,False,2,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYkasjN2WVeimmpl7sQ9FnWRUZLlaYNRWhJnkF=w450-h675-p-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRfFqJUe9qOA3EPLiGZKwYUCo_uCQo9_u9jaoS=w450-h675-p-k-no",Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found

When the children met me a staff member immediately came to the table and demanded I.D. from my 13yr old niece for the red wine (she doesnt even look 13, looks younger) I explained it was mine and was then questioned that both wine was indeed for myself, when i explained how long I had been sat drinking the wine, Inwas then informed that she thought I was a kid also anyway, although never asked for ID and i am 45!
We were then made to feel vey uncomfortable, staring everytime she passed, clearly discussing us with other members of staff totally ruined my visit,made me feel as though I was doing something wrong. All the children I were with were all under 13 and looked it and I am not in the habit of buyong kids alcohol whilst out on a sunday afternoon. Very rude.

Ridiculous, not alcohol just food, so I ordered for them. Then I ordered for myself and my younger brother separate to my cousins, with our meals I ordered 2 cans of monster, one for me and 1 for my 16 year old brother, they gave us the monster and we paid for it, 5 minutes later the lady came to the table very hostile asking if my brother had ID, he didn‚Äôt, like most 16 year olds he doesn‚Äôt carry ID, so basically he wasn‚Äôt allowed to drink the monster because he couldn‚Äôt prove he was 16 so I said fair enough can we have a refund or can his monster be exchanged for a Pepsi, we were told no very rudely and that our only option was that I drink the monster or she has to take it from my brother, we went back and forward for a bit as I couldn‚Äôt understand why we couldn‚Äôt have a refund or at least have the drink exchanged and for the duration of our meal we were getting constant stares from her and we could see her whispering to other staff while looking directly at us.

They had to go back home and get their IDs while the rest of us were eating. General poor attitude and tone from the manager. It‚Äôs a shame because we go here frequently as a family.

Here‚Äôs a piece of advice: the world is not run on rules followed to the extreme. Sometimes, tact and being socially adept go a long way.

We paid by the app and this was a seemingly pain free process. Granted the person who delivered the main course lacked a little in customer service skills. But maybe that was down to lack of training.

Silver Wolf,a year ago,1,"Me and my mother had decided to sit and have lunch here while doing our Christmas shopping at the trafford centre. We had put aside 40 minutes and then we had to leave because we were needed elsewhere. We sat and ordered.The food was supposed to be 10 mins. 20 minutes later I go and as for our oreder since we were on a time limit. Half an hour later I go and ask them to box our meals since they wasted so much of our time. Thankfully the order time was noted on their app otherwise thy would try to sell us the story of ""Ma'am I see your order it hasnt been 10 minutes yet."" Then they brought out just a box of pizza and told us the salad we had ordered wasn't avaliable. Why weren't we told that 30 mins ago? We demanded the salad be refunded. They came out with the receipt stating that they refunded the whole order.A day later no money has come through from them.Never eating with them again. I will update this review with what happens to the refund.

Update: Its been three months and no money has come through. Do with that what you will.",1,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
