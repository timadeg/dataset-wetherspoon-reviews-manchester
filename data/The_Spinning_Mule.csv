Marie Fox,3 days ago,5,"A great pub/establishment. It has a lovely cafe area and a great bar also. The cafe is relatively cheap and give a great offer on brews, with a cup of tea, coffee or hot chocolate for ¬£1.50 with unlimited refill which is great if you have lots of work to catch up on and like a nice relaxed atmosphere to do it in. The nightlife is also great, since I've been a teenager this place has had a lovely crowd of people with great music and sports for the fanatics...",112,No photos count,True,0,,¬£1‚Äì10,5,5,5,"Veggie Breakfast, Fish and Chips, Noodles, Lamb Shank, Traditional Breakfast, Eggs Benedict, Lasagna, Pizza, Six Onion Rings, Toast, Caramel Cookie Dough, Empire Burger, 3 Small Plates, And Chips, Mushroom Benidict, Chicken Tikka Masala, Cauliflower Curry, Fish, Burger, Chicken Burger"
Benjamin Smyth,2 months ago,5,"When they say ""you get what you pay for"" it's not always a good thing - and in this case even so, as you get more than you would expect for your money. The drinks selection is vast & inexpensive, the food is decent and very good value for money, combine the two (if you can find your ideal meal that includes a drink) and you're talking incredible value - Steak dinner with a large premium IPA for a tenner? That'll do.

Bolton town centre's own Wetherspoons is nicely located, usually aptly staffed and the service is quick & pleasant. I can usually find a seat to dine peacefully uninterrupted on both weekend and weekday visits. The staff are attentive and considerate.

On the constructive side, the recently added outdoor area round the back is pretty pointless as it is far from a sun tap, and even as a non smoker I don't understand why it's there if you can't smoke there (yes I understand the legislation & definition of suitable smoking areas). Also the table arrangement of the main bar/drinking/dining area is a bit erratic, the tables seem cramped in places & randomly positioned.

Another thing for those looking to enhance their Wetherspoons experience; get the app. I know not all Wetherspoons have the fast service Bolton offers (Westhoughton was beyond painful) but it's easy to use, order, modify your preferences and is by far easier than trying to remember your family meal order at the bar.",79,56,True,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHJFj9HB4W4AS31G5YSlnryO6cMyaiY3dQzK8h=w900-h675-p-k-no,¬£10‚Äì20,4,4,3,"Fish and Chips, Traditional Breakfast, Pizza, Six Onion Rings"

zac cruz,2 years ago,5,"My spirit is one with nature, from the deepest sand beneath the oceans through to the furthest forest my soul flows. Even though I am one with nature I have no roots. I am a traveller. Always have been. The winds guide me, pulling me ever towards the horizon. Following the brightest star, searching for a new sunrise.

Until I grew weary...

I fell upon the stone steps of the Spinning Mule. Weak and broken, I had all but given up. Until I heard a warm voice, the voice of an Irishman. Dave. He taught me the ways of 3 small plates for ¬£10.95. I can never repay him.

Next, a raven haired queen, Helen. With all knowledge of the contents of 2 for only ¬£10 pitchers, I drifted into the abyss of her warmth. For who wouldn't?.

Third, a prince among men, Dan. A man whose bartending intellect and skill could put even the most experienced bartender to shame. He resides in the kitchen displaying his culinary expertise. His greatest skills stay dormant, as he remains humble, yet powerful.

The fourth, perhaps the darkest of the four. His skills lay not within the realm of physical, tangible things. It lay within his devilish charm, his way with words, his debonair style and finesse. A wink, a smile a few sharp words from him and you were his. His name? A name that echoes in my head, and I hope will remain. Seb.

The other staff were lovely too, food was made in good time, tables could have been wiped more though.

It's a bit dark and dated inside but there is plenty of seating and gives a warm and relaxed atmosphere.

Other good thing is refillable hot drinks so you can have as many as you like for the price of one.

Andrew Dixon,a year ago,1,"Absolutely god awful food. Ordered nachos, garlic bread and empire state burger. I always order this same burger whichever wether spoons I go to because it's usually fantastic and value for money. This burger was terrible, dry over cooked yet somehow cold as the cheese wouldn't melt and the dry bun fell apart. The garlic bread came without any garlic butter on and was very dry. The nachos came cold and without cheese, when we sent them back they were gone 10 minutes and came back with a small (and I mean small)sprinkling of grated cheese melted onto the nachos so much it was rock hard. At this point we got up and just left! Won't be going back to a wether spoons for a long time.

Jan Rhodes,2 years ago,2,"I've just downgraded it to 2 stars.
I had a terrible meal a few days ago...I ordered the cauliflower curry and that was the only thing that was edible.  The garlic nann was like cardboard, definitely not cooked fresh, I'd also paid extra for the garlic but couldn't taste it, the rice was one solid ball, again overly cooked and dry.  The poppadoms were greasy and chewy. I said earlier that the curry was the only edible part but this was so bland if you'd blindfolded me I wouldn't have guessed it was a curry.
To top it all it was packed, which is great for them but any free table was stacked high with dirty dishes and glasses, plus the App wasn't working properly, I couldn't order my meal with a soft drink,  only alcohol so I had to go to the bar. When I mentioned the dirty tables they said that they were short staffed.

The review below is what I left last time,  what a difference a year makes! üòü

Excellent value for money both drinks and food,  good quick service,  great food with brilliant choice,  especially for vegetarians.  A very popular place but just a pity the clientele are a bit rough and decor is scruffy and dated. Toilets are up stairs which is a bit of a hike,  not good if your either desperate or drunk. Using the new Wetherspoons App is great, you never need to leave your table to order food and drink. Easy to use with quick service.
