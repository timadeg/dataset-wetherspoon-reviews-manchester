paul brown,3 months ago,3,"Some interesting photos on the wall about the locality and key figures. One includes a photo of The Benjamin Satchwell Wetherspoons in Leamington Spa.
I waited over 5 minutes to be served despite only one customer being served. The server said her key had froze. Not sure why another member of staff couldn't serve me.
Eventually, I got my Shipyard, and it was okay.

Prices are obviously decent, staff are super lovely, the food though - not great, not good, and really borderline adequate.
On this particular day I ordered a deli wrap and paid extra for chips. Given the amount I was charged for the meal with extra chips, I was unhappy with the small portion of food.

Nice and cool in the summer
Good location near the train stations and bus station
Large so plenty seating
Very fast drink service

Cons;
Cold food
No televisions for the Euros

Late night food should 100% come with a “chef may not give a shit” warning.
I have seen my 4 year old niece microwave and plate up a meal with better results.

I have noticed that this chain as gone down hill over the years but this one has hit an all time new record of low quality.

OMG Exploring,a year ago,1,"40 minute wait for a breakfast on a Sunday morning for it to arrive cold.
Truthfully it’s not that nice neither it’s been microwaved.

This place as seriously gone down hill. I

f I could rate 0 stars I would.

Tables are left with plates on them & the place is just in a BIG mess.

Nicest part is the coffee, its from a machine but I must say this place isn’t clean or serve the food correctly I doubt the beers taste nice to and the lines aren’t cleaned regularly too.

It’s just down to poor management skills without experience to run a venue like this.

tom sinclair,2 years ago,3,"If you love a Wetherspoons then this is a safe option, plenty seating and not too hot in the summer due to the AC, however, if you like it cold i hope that also applies to your food. I ordered three mini plates for 12 quid and to be fair the portions were rather big but they were very cold which ruined my fries but the nachos were still good.

Pros;
Nice and cool in the summer
Good location near the train stations and bus station
Large so plenty seating
Very fast drink service

Cons;
Cold food
No televisions for the Euros
The cutlery they gave me was filthy like theres no way it had even seen a sink

All in all I'd go as pit stop for a few decent drinks then move down towards king street for the atmosphere or up to the local John Bull Chophouse if you like your rock music and ale.

John Mcnamara,3 years ago,1,"Went in sunday 30th of August, between 10.30 and 11pm. Guy at the door very welcoming. Allowed 6 of us in. Soon after sitting down and ordering drinks by the app', security guy came over and abruptly asked why 6 of us were sat together. Told him that guy at door had allowed 6 of us in and we were allowed. He went and bought over another security guy, who also questioned us. Eventually a nice lady member of staff came over and said it was ok. One of the security guys continued to hover near us and staring all the time we were in there. Felt like we had done something wrong. Drank up quickly and left. Maybe a review of 1 is a bit unfair.

Staff nowhere to be seen so tables may have remained unclean and uncleared for very, very long periods.  The coffee dispensed was barely lukewarm.

I got the impression she thought I'd already drank some of it. Her lack of any response, apologetic or otherwise led me to think this.

No-one asked what our food was like. I'm sorry to say it wasn't as good as usual. The fish did not taste fresh.

Such a shame as it’s a lovely building and well situated in the centre of town.
The staff are generally very friendly, but probably understaffed.
