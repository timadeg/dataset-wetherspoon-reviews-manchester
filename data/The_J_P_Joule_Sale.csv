Eudora,5 months ago,3,What can I say? It's just a big standard pub in a handy location. Reasonably priced as the chain is well known for. Some rough people go there and its quite noisy! It was packed as there was some football match on. Had to look for a table upstairs. However it was pleasant enough for a catch up with a family member. We saw a couple lady with a curry and it looked quite nice for a pub meal.  Would definitely return on a quieter night and perhaps order food too.,99,106,True,0,,¬£1‚Äì10,Not rated,3,3,Not found

Service was prompt and food was good. Had a good selection of bar drinks, plenty draught and bottled and enough selection of low and alcohol free.

Place was cosy with upstairs seating, clean and tidy. It's right in the centre of Sale so conveniently located.

Will definitely use this place again when over this way.

Ciar√°n Wright,a year ago,1,"I rarely rate Wetherspoons pubs as they are always great value for money and very friendly service but today at JP Joule I had the worst experience at a Wetherspoons ever.
Whoever was ""managing"" the upstairs part informed me after booking drinks on the App I had to go downstairs and order from now on as they were short of staff. No problem, I went downstairs for my next order and overheard staff complaining about upstairs.
My next order I decided to order on the App as the bars were quite and bar staff were standing around. I waited 10 minutes and remembering I was told by the ""manager"" upstairs there was no service for orders allowed up from downstairs I went down and complained after complaining I received my order promptly.
If there is an app/staff problem Wetherspoons need to make this clearer as it can lead to very unhappy customers

Service was prompt and food was good. Had a good selection of bar drinks, plenty draught and bottled and enough selection of low and alcohol free.

Place was cosy with upstairs seating, clean and tidy. It's right in the centre of Sale so conveniently located.

Will definitely use this place again when over this way.

Or even a written allergy menu upstairs this save traipsing up and down the stairs before you can order food. Gripe over,it's still a good pub.

The staff here are great. Very friendly, attentive, and care about their customers, their work, and their beers. They will happily offer a taster before buying, or a top up once the head settles after pulling the pint.

Food didn't take long at all.

Ordered the Large mixed grill with a drink.
Probably the best meal I've ever had in a wetherspoons.
The lamb and stake were cooked perfectly, medium rare and with lots of flavour.
Fired egg was sunny side up, giving an extra bit of flavor and lots of colour to the plate.
The grilled tomato and mushroom, spot on.
Same for the onion rings and baked potato.

Ciar√°n Wright,a year ago,1,"I rarely rate Wetherspoons pubs as they are always great value for money and very friendly service but today at JP Joule I had the worst experience at a Wetherspoons ever.
Whoever was ""managing"" the upstairs part informed me after booking drinks on the App I had to go downstairs and order from now on as they were short of staff. No problem, I went downstairs for my next order and overheard staff complaining about upstairs.
My next order I decided to order on the App as the bars were quite and bar staff were standing around. I waited 10 minutes and remembering I was told by the ""manager"" upstairs there was no service for orders allowed up from downstairs I went down and complained after complaining I received my order promptly.
If there is an app/staff problem Wetherspoons need to make this clearer as it can lead to very unhappy customers

EDIT: Dropped into here, Thursday 1st July. A daft interpretation of the rules outside. Two tables only at non smoking, none at smoking (I'm mobility impaired, I need to sit a lot), with no way to access the ""other side"" without donning a mask, entering the building, crossing the doors to the exit to the smoking area. Daft, & extremely frustrating.
Still a top chain, though! I just won't be coming back here until this improves.",111,No photos count,False,0,,Not found,Not rated,Not rated,Not rated,Not found
